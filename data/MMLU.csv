1,"Dear Mr.Watson, CLAIM AL54323432--STORM DAMAGE TO ROOF I received a cheque for $623 dated 26 January in payment of my recent claim .However, I wish to tell you how upset I have been by the way your Claims Assessor, Mr.Michael Tan, handled this claim. When Mr.Tan first called me, he specifically told me that he believed I had been overcharged, and he would expect to pay that price for work on a double garage, rather than a single garage like mine.Mr.Tan suggested that I neither use nor recommend _ again.He continued to tell me it was unlikely for me to receive full payment.Never during this conversation did he mention that the reason for not receiving full payment was because of the nature of my insurance policy. Consequently, I wrote to Mr.Lance Ashe to complain about his pricing, stating that I was very upset thinking that he could have taken advantage by overcharging a 73-year-old woman.Mr.Ashe telephoned me immediately and explained his charges in detail.He later reported back to me that Mr.Tan explained that I would not receive full payment because of the type of policy I hold, which does not cover wear and tear.This was the first time this issue had been brought to my attention, so you can imagine my surprise. When I received Mr.Tan's letter of 2 February, this situation was explained.If this had been explained in the first place I would have accepted it and would not have questioned Mr.Ashe's charges.Instead, by telling me initially that I had been overcharged for this work, he caused a great deal of upset, not only for me but also for Mr.Ashe. I believed this claim was handled badly by Mr.Tan from the beginning.Therefore, a great deal of embarrassment has been caused over this issue. I felt you should know how disappointed and upset I am.I trust you will look into this and ensure that such claims are handled more appropriately in the future. Yours sincerely, Mrs.Richard We can learn from the passage that Mr.Tan works in a/an   _  .",welfare organization,nursing house,local affairs office,insurance company,D
2,"China Merchants Bank Co Ltd has teamed up with ride-hailing major Didi Kuaidi to provide automobile financing and expand its reach in China's booming mobile payment industry. The two have inked a comprehensive partnership, which includes a strategic investment by the former in the latter. Under the partnership, CMB will become the first bricks-and-mortar bank that can offer in-app credit card payments to Didi users. At present, users of Didi can only choose third-party payment solutions like WeChat Payment and Alipay to pay cab fares. Zhao Ju, vice-president of CMB, said the cooperation with Didi was an important step in its mobile Internet finance strategy. ""CMB's mobile payment is going to enter a new chapter by leveraging Didi Kuaidi's vast user base,"" he said. According to a report by China Internet Network Information Center earlier this month, Didi holds 87.2 percent of China's private car hailing market. The company said it has received 1.43 billion car-hailing requests on its platforms in 2015, which means 1.43 billion payments were made via smartphones. CMB is expected to use Didi to reach the core users of China's mobile payment market. Jean Liu, president of Didi, said many of the expats prefer payment by credit card rather than Alipay or WeChat. ""The new partnership will help improve service quality and customer loyalty,"" she said. The investment makes CMB part of Didi's existing investors, including Tencent Holdings Ltd, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and China Investment Corporation. Both of the companies declined to reveal the actual amount of the investment. Liu, who showed up on Tuesday for the first time in public after her treatment for breast cancer, said the cooperation with CMB is for the long run and ""the capital investment is only part of it"". Under the partnership, CMB and Didi will cooperate on a wide range of initiatives on financial services and online-to-offline cooperation. Apart from the in-app credit card payments, the two companies are going to launch joint credit cards in late February and automobile financing services for Didi's car owners. CMB's branches across China are expected to help Didi recruit more drivers. ""There is a lot of room for imagination in our partnership,"" Li said, adding in future people may use their CMB credit card reward points to pay for the ride on Didi. Li Chao, an analyst with iResearch Consulting Group, said the partnership may not significantly boost CMB's mobile payment business. ""Didi has educated the market for three years and its customers have formed the habit of paying by WeChat or Alipay. So I think CMB can only turn a very smart proportion of Didi users into its payment customer,"" he said. ""But the move shows that China's traditional banking industry is finally thinking out of the box and looking for outside partners in Internet finance competition,"" he said. Statistics from Big-Data Research showed that more than 90 percent of China's 9.3 trillion yuan ($1.41 trillion) worth of third party mobile payment market is donated by Alibaba and Tencent. The main idea of this passage is that   _  .?",CMB develops partnership with Didi Kuaidi.,CMB is looking for outside partners in Internet finance competition.,Didi Kuaidi is going to enter a new chapter.,Alibaba and Tencent dominate the mobile payment market.,A
3,"Pepys and his wife had asked some friends to dinner on Sunday, September 2nd, 1666. The servants were up very late on the Saturday evening, getting everything ready for the next day, and while they were busy they saw the glow of a fire start in the sky. By 3 o'clock on the Sunday morning, the glow had become so bright that one of the servants, Jane, woke her master to see it. Pepys went to the window to watch it. It seemed fairly far away, so after a time he went back to bed. When he got up in the morning, it looked as though the fire was dying down, though he could still see some flames. So he set to work to tidy his room and put his things back where he wanted them after the servants had cleaned everything. While he was doing this, Jane came in to say that she had heard that the fire was a bad one: three hundred houses had been burned down in the night and the fire was still burning. Pepys went out to see for himself. He went to the Tower of London and climbed up on a high part of the building so that he could see what was happening. From there, Pepys could see that it was, indeed, a bad fire and that even the houses on London Bridge were burning. Someone told him that the fire had started in a baker's house in Pudding Lane, and then the flames had quickly spread to the other houses in the narrow lane. So began the Great Fire of London, a fire that lasted nearly five days, damaged most of the old city and ended, so it is said, at Pie Corner. The servants were up very late because   _  .",they were chatting,they were having a party,they were preparing for a dinner,they were watching a fire,C

5,"If you try to explain to someone, without using pictures, how to build the building that you have designed, it would take an enormous amount of writing and might end up with a very funny-looking building. The architect uses pictures called details to show how many hundreds of parts go together to form a complete building. This type of drawing is called drafting and is done by people called draftsmen.  Draftsmen make up the largest group of the architectural offices' work force. Because of the wide range of duties they perform, draftsmen are sometimes called architectural technicians. In a typical office, there are not only career draftsmen but also architectural graduates working as junior draftsmen to learn the trade. Career draftsmen are usually graduates from a two-year junior college called technical school. There was a time when architectural office used young people right out of high school as tracers. Their job was to trace over the other people's details while learning to be a draftsman. This is no longer possible with the fast-pace of architects' offices today although a junior draftsman is given guides by the more experienced employees.      So a good comprehensive architectural drafting course is a must before anyone seeks a job with an architectural firm. The job of the draftsmen is to translate the ideas and directions of architects, designers and engineers into complete and accurate working drawings. These become the plans and details used in the actual construction of a building. The project must be shown in great detail and drawn very clearly, so there is no chance for misunderstanding by the contractors . Every line and figure has an effect on the finished product.      As you can see, the draftsman is a key member of the architectural team. Of course, a junior draftsman is not expected to produce a complete set of working drawings. Depending on the size of the office and difficulty of the project, draftsmen may work in groups. The group leader coordinates the group and works closely with the project architect while the drawings are being produced.      Working conditions are mostly very pleasant as draftsmen's work is intense and many people depend on accurate work. Each draftsman has a large combination drawing board and desk with various drawing aids. Almost without exception, members of the architectural team have at one time in their careers worked as draftsmen. This is essential to an architect education and most architects never get very far away from the drafting board. What is most essential for draftsmen's work according to the author?",An architect education.,The spirit of team work.,Accuracy in the drawings.,Advanced drawing aids.,C
6,"People without homes have always been present in America. In the past,they were called hobos,bums,or drifters. It was not until the early 1980s that these people received a new name,when activists named them the homeless. The types of people who were homeless also changed in the 1980s. No longer were they primarily older men. They were younger,with an average age of 35. Their numbers consisted of women,children,adolescents and entire families. They were of many races and cultures. No longer were they only in the inner city. They lived in rural areas and in large and small cities. No longer were they invisible to the people with homes and jobs. The homeless of the 1980s lived in packing crates   and doorways. They slept on sidewalks and in public parks. They begged money from passersby. Counting the numbers of homeless people is difficult. However,in 1984 the Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated the homeless population at between 250,000 and 350,000. In 1990 the Census Bureau counted about 459,000 people in shelters,in cheap hotels,and on the streets. In 1995 the National Alliance to End Homelessness estimated that there were 750,000 homeless Americans. The homeless of the 1980s also began to speak out for themselves. Some spoke to Congress and to government committees controlling funding for social programs. Street newspapers,such as Chicago's Streetwise and Boston's Spare Change,had stories,poems,and essays that expressed the homeless viewpoint. The visible and vocal presence of the homeless prompted help from volunteers and government agencies. But what is still needed is a solution to the _ of America's homeless population. This passage is mainly about  _  .",one homeless person's story,the history of the homeless,the changes of the homeless in the late 20th century,a way to provide homes for the homeless,C
7,"My parents are amazing. I had the most wonderful childhood, and it's not because I had everything I wanted or because I was a cool kid. I have learned a lot about parenting from what my parents did. Here are a few gems   that I use now or plan to use in the future with my two boys. Here's how a conversation often went when I was a kid. Usually it was around 4:30 p.m. I said, ""I'm hungry. Can I have a cookie?"" My mom answered, ""No. Have a banana."" ""I don't want a banana."" ""Then you're not hungry."" Sometimes I was angry about it, but I knew that was good for me. Thanks mom for not letting me eat junk food  . Now I agree with my mother and I have this same conversation with my three-year-old son. I hope it helps him form healthy diet habits. I know many of us heard this as children. ""If everyone jumped off a bridge, would you do it, too?"" If our kids asked for something just because everyone else had it or was doing it, we often got this response. It was the perfect response, and we soon learned not to ask for things because everyone else had it, but because it was something we wanted. I will always be thankful that my parents let us try the things that interested us, not the things they wanted to push us into. This helped me try swimming, dance, and the piano before second grade. I found a love -- singing -- and kept up with that through my college years. It drives me crazy, as a mom and teacher, when I see kids who are pushed into their parents' favorite activities, even when they don't have a passion for them.

Ironically,Oymyakon actually means""nonfreezing water""due to a nearby hot spring.Most homes in Oymyakon still burn coal and wood for heat and enjoy few modern conveniences. Nothing grows there so people eat reindeer meat and horsemeat.A single shop provides the town's bare necessities and the locals work as reindeerbreeders,hunters and icefishermen. There are few modern conveniences in the village--with many buildings still having outdoor toilets--and most people still burn coal and wood for heat.When coal deliveries are irregular,the power station starts burning wood.If the power ceases,the town shuts down in about five hours,and the pipes freeze and crack. Daily problems that come with living in Oymyakon include pen ink freezing,glasses freezing to people's faces and batteries losing power.Locals are said to leave their cars running all day for fear of not being able to restart them.Even if there was coverage for mobile phone reception,the phones themselves would not work in such conditions. Another problem caused by the frozen temperatures is burying dead bodies,which can take anything up to three days.The earth must first have thawed sufficiently in order to dig it,so a bonfire is lit for a couple of hours.Hot coals are then pushed to the side and a hole couple of inches deep is dug.The process is repeated for several days until the hole is deep enough to bury the coffin.

MacDonald, who has spent much of his time since graduating from college backpacking round Europe and Asia and whose main income appears to come from working as a pizza-delivery man, decided last year that he wanted to settle down. However, when he checked the real estate market, he quickly realized that he had no chance of raising the depositon a home of his own. So he came up with an inventive solution. Using the power of the Internet, he decided to try to barter  his way to a house. His starting offer One red paper clip  . Of course, he didn't expect someone to offer him a house for the paper clip, he simply wanted to trade it for something that was more valuable. 14 trades later, he is now the owner of a house in Kipling, Saskatchewan. His first trade took place when two women from his hometown offered him a pen in the shape of a fish. MacDonald then traded the fish-pen for a doorknob, then the doorknob for a stove. Further _ brought him an electricity generator and a ski-bob, a small vehicle on tracks that people use to ride across snow and ice. After nine trades, he had a recording contract at a music studio in Toronto. But Kyle pressed on, still convinced that he would eventually get a house. After trades which brought him the opportunity to spend a day with rock star Alice Cooper and to have a small part in a Hollywood movie, he struck gold. When words of Kyle's astonishing barter journey reached the people of Kipling, they decided to make their move. The population of the town is a little more than l,000, and falling fast.

12,"United States President George W.  Bush is expected to issue a directive in the next few weeks. It will give the US Air Force a green light for the development of space weapons, US media reported last week. This would potentially start a new global arms race, some experts have warned.  To keep that from happening, last Wednesday the White House explained that it was not considering putting weapons in space.  It said it was making a shift inprefix = st1 /USspace policy to allow for protection of satellites. But some defense analysts and arms control advocates argue that the policy will pave the way for the US to put both defensive and offensive ( ) weapons in space.  ""No one should be fooled,"" said Theresa Hitchens, an American weapons expert.  The USis now restricted by a 1996 directive  signed by President Bill Clinton. Plans for space weapons were vetoed   by the Clinton cabinet.  The directive emphasized the peaceful use of space , in agreement with almost unanimous ( ) global opinion.  The USmilitary has placed importance on space and has sent up numberous satellites for troop communications and to provide intelligence and data to guide bombs to their targets. The US Air Force wants to develop space- based weapons that could strike targets anywhere in the world within 90 minutes of receiving the order to open fire.  These new weapons under development cover a wide range.  They include hunter- killer satellites and orbiting weapons. And they use lasers, radio waves, or even dense metal tubes, known as "" Rods from God"", dropped from space to do the damage. There are many barriers to the setting up of this kind of program, experts say.  First is the coast.  It is estimated that the budget may be US $220 billion to US $ 1 trillion  .  The technical difficulties of developing reliable space weapons are also a problem.  And, the program will draw strong criticism from around the world.

14,"SAN FRANCISCO -- In the western U.S., Hawaii and elsewhere across the globe, moon watchers were treated on Saturday to a rare celestial  phenomenon: a total lunar eclipse  . For about 50 minutes starting at 6:06 a.m. PST, the moon was completely blocked by the Earth's shadow. With only some indirect sunlight able to reach it after passing through the Earth's atmosphere, the moon took on a reddish weak light. Since the atmosphere scatters  blue light, only red light strikes the moon, giving it a dark red color1. Dally Sam, who runs a public relations firm in Hawaii, said it had been cloudy and rainy, but the weather cleared just in time for the eclipse. Around 3 a.m., he awoke, as he usually does, and remembered to step outside the house in time to catch the beginning of the eclipse about a half hour later. No one else in the neighborhood was up then. ""It was turning that dark red color1,"" Sayre, aged 47, said, ""I'd better get a camera. To be able to see it just right outside our house was really cool."" At the local observatory in Los Angeles, some 300 people, many holding coffee cups in the cold morning air, sat with blankets and chairs on the observatory's great grass land. ""It's really a celestial festival out here,"" John Peter, aged 39, told the Los Angeles Times as he set up his camera. Lying on a slope  north of downtown near the Hollywood sign, the place offers clear views of the sky. Observatory officials reminded the crowd when the eclipse began and big applause burst when the celestial event ended. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon goes through the long shadow cast by the Earth and is blocked from the sunlight that brightens it. ks5u What do we know about the lunar eclipse from the passage?",The total lunar eclipse began at about 3:30 a.m..,The total lunar eclipse ended at about 6:56 a.m..,The lunar eclipse ended at about 6:56 in the evening.,The lunar eclipse began at about 6:06 in the evening.,B

It was coming on Mother's Day, and he usually tried to make it ""back home"", but this year he was just too tired. He was in a small town just outside of Little Rock when he drove by a flower shop. He said to himself, ""I know what I will do, I'll send Mom some roses."" He went into the small shop and saw a young man talking to the clerk. ""How many roses can I get for six dollars, madam?"" the boy asked. The clerk was trying to explain that roses were expensive. Maybe the young man would be happy with  _ .  ""No. I have to have roses."" He said, ""My mom was sick so much last year and I didn't get to spend much time with her. I want to get something special. It has to be red roses, because that's her favorite."" He was firm. The clerk looked up at John and was just shaking her head. Something inside of John was touched by the boy's voice. He wanted to get those roses so badly. John had been blessed in his business, and he looked at the clerk and silently mouthed he would pay for the boy's roses.  The clerk looked at the young man and said, ""OK, I will give you a dozen red roses for six dollars."" The young man almost jumped into the air. He took the flowers and ran from the store. It was worth the extra thirty-five dollars just to see that kind of excitement. John ordered his own flowers and had the clerk be sure that delivery would include a note telling his mother how much he loved her. As he drove away from the shop, he was feeling very good. He caught a light about two blocks from the shop. As he waited at the light, he saw the young boy walking down the sidewalk. He watched him cross the street and enter a park through two huge gates. Suddenly he realized it wasn't a park. It was a cemetery . He could see the young man turn there by gate and walk along the fence. The light changed, and John slowly crossed the crossing. He pulled over and on an impulse  got out and began to follow the boy down the fence line. John was on the sidewalk, thirty or forty steps behind the boy, who walked inside the cemetery fence. The young man stopped by a small monument and went on his knees. He carefully laid the roses on the tomb and began to sob. John felt like an intruder but he couldn't leave. He stared at the little boy's trembling body and listened to his silent crying.  As he cried, he heard the young man speak, ""Mommy, oh Mommy, why didn't I tell you how much I love you? Why didn't I tell you one more time? Jesus, please, find my mommy. Tell my Mommy I love her."" John turned, tears in his eyes, and walked back to his car.

19,"I sat with my friend in a well-known coffee shop in a neighboring town of Venice. As we enjoyed our coffee, a man called the waiter and placed his order, ""Two cups of coffee, one on the wall."" We got interested and observed that he was served with one cup of coffee but he paid for two. As soon as he left, the waiter attached a piece of paper to the wall saying ""A Cup of Coffee."" Similar occasions took place twice while we were there. It seemed that this gesture was quite normal at this place. However, it was something unique and confusing for us. After a few days, when we again enjoyed coffee there, a man entered. The way this man was dressed did not match the standard or the atmosphere of this coffee shop. Poverty was evident from his looks. As he seated himself, he looked at the wall and said, ""One cup of coffee from the wall."" The waiter served coffee to this man with respect and dignity. The man had his coffee and left without paying. We were amazed to watch all this when the waiter took off a piece of paper from the wall and threw it in the dustbin. Now it was no surprise for us; the matter was very clear. The great respect for the needy shown by people in this town moved us to tears. Coffee is not a necessity. However, the point is that when we take pleasure in any blessing, maybe we also need to think about those people who also appreciate that specific blessing but cannot afford. Note the waiter, who gets the communication going between the affording and the needy with a smile on his face. Think about the man in need: he enters the coffee shop without having to lower his self-dignity; he has a free cup of coffee without asking or knowing about who has given this cup of coffee to him; he only looked at the wall, placed an order for himself, enjoyed his coffee and left. Besides, we need to remember the role played by the wall that reflects the generosity and care of people in this town. The passage is mainly concerned about   _  .",learning from the waiter,buying coffee for others,caring more about the people in need,analyzing the characters in the coffee shop,C
20,"When I decided to write the story of my early years growing up in poverty,many of my friends and family members were shocked.They were more interested in my story of success,such as how I was able to create the nation's largest law firm and sell it to a bank,and how one sells a law firm for millions of dollars.That's the story everyone wanted me to write,but it's not the story I wanted to tell. Looking back,I see so clearly how often,throughout my boyhood,I was touched by random acts of kindness that helped shape me into the man I am today.And random acts of violence and ignorance played just a powerful role in making me who I am.Becoming a successful lawyer involves hard work,but escaping generational poverty is the hardest thing I have ever done. I chose to write the story of my childhood years in poverty,with the hope that a child somewhere in the world will read my story and be inspired to break the cycle of poverty.My publisher was quick to point out that the market would be small for a memoir   written by a  ly unknown author.To everyone's surprise,the book received over 1,000 prepublication orders one month before the scheduled launch date.The book launch scheduled for October 1,was moved up to September 14.Less than four months later,the first print run of 5,000 copies were sold out. Today,the memoir is being used by universities,high schools and middle schools,as a case study of the behavior patterns of the culture of poverty as well as valuable lessons on how to succeed in life.Here is a quote from the principal of a middle school in Texas on October 27,who is using my memoir for students 5th through 8th grades:""We are halfway through your story.It is changing the lives of our students and the perspectives of our teachers.""

So it is not surprising that many expressions about _ are still used by Americans today. Long ago, people who were rich or important rode horses that were very tall. Today, if a girl is too proud and looks down upon others, you might say she should ""get off her high horse."" Last night, I got a telephone call while I was watching my favorite television show. I decided not to answer it because ""wild horses could not drag me away"" from the television -- there was nothing that could stop me from doing what I wanted to do. Sometimes you get information ""straight from the horse's mouth."" It comes directly from the person who knows most about the subject and is the best source. Let us say your teacher tells you there is going to be a test tomorrow. You could say you got the information ""straight from the horse's mouth."" However, you would not want to call your teacher a horse! You may have heard this expression: ""You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make him drink."" That means you can give someone advice but you cannot force him to do something he does not want to do. In politics, a ""dark-horse candidate"" is someone who is not well known to the public. Sometimes, a dark horse unexpectedly wins an election . Another piece of advice is ""do not change horses in midstream.""

27,"I  learned a  long  time ago  that hair has meanings--plenty of meanings. Growing up  in  the 1960s, my friends and I struggled without parents' control over the length and style of our hair. At  the  time,  hair  represented  our  need  to  break  free  from  adults  in  our  lives.  Long  hair represented our freed inner selves. My clients are often surprised when I asked them questions about their hairstyle--why they choose it, how else they've worn their hair, how they feel about it, and so on. However, while it may  seem  to  be  a  simple  topic,  even  today  our  hairstyles  still  have many  psychological  and emotional meanings. Understanding some of those meanings can lead to understanding of many different aspects of a person's mind. How we view our hair,  for example, can show something about how we view ourselves. Our  hair  can  show  physical  and  emotional wellbeing,  desirability,  and  even  social  and financial  status. When  it  becomes  dull  or  fragile,  it  can  communicate  emotional  and  physical diseases. But hair can also show unrecognized and often unspoken daydreams about oneself and one's world. One woman--a successful professional--wore her long hair in a thick bun . But  one  day  she  showed me  that  tangled  hair was kept  in  the bun. She  said  that  she never brushed out the tangles because the hair showed her secret image of herself as a helpless, disturbed woman, like Ophelia in the play Hamlet. Another woman came to therapy in a huge shirt and huge pants that she believed they could hide the weight she had put on since the birth of her child. She talked about how much she hated her  body  and  how  helpless  she  felt  about  doing  anything  about  it.  But  her  hair  was  always beautifully  coloured  and  decorated. When  I  pointed  out  that  she  seemed  to  have  a  different relationship with her hair  from she did with her body, she said  that her hair had been  thinning and  that she was  trying  to make  it  look as good as she  could.  I pointed out  that what she was doing  with  her  hair  and  her  body  was  kind  of  contradictory,  and  wondered  if  she  had  any thoughts about that. She was surprised. But as we talked about her contradictory attitudes towards different parts of her physical self, we began to open up all sorts of other thoughts and ideas about her inner self. And interestingly, as we continued opening those internal doors, changes started to happen. She started eating differently and exercising  regularly. One day some months  later, she appeared  in my  office  in  skinny  jeans  and  a  tight  sweater,  and  her  hair was  pulled  back  in  a  ponytail.  ""I decided to see what would happen if I stopped trying to hide myself, "" she said with a big smile. ""And...?  ""  I  asked.  ""People  keep  smiling  at  me  in  the  street. My  husband  hugged  me  this morning for the first time in ages. And I feel good! "" Besides, selfrespect in both men and women can be damaged by thinning hair;they may feel  alone  even  though  they  are  really  not. Given  our  cultural  focus  on  physical  appearance, youth, and health, hair loss can be unpleasant for both men and women. The market is filled with hairenhancing  treatments, but  there  are  those who  have decided  to be  against  the  system  and change to the ""bald is beautiful"" position. But it is much harder for women to take the ""bald is beautiful"" approach to hair loss. We tend to try to hide it in one way or another. But no matter what approach you use, it is important to remember that the thickness of your hair  has  nothing  to  do with  your  value  in  the world. Remember  that  you  have  nothing  to  be ashamed of if you have thinning hair. Thinning hair may not be something you can change, but it doesn't have to control how you represent the person who lives underneath it. What can we know about the woman wearing her long hair in a thick bun?",She had long but thinning hair.,She was helpless and disturbed.,She was too busy to brush her hair.,She loved the play Hamlet very much.,B

That's down by seven places comparing with that last year. The Chinese mainland belongs to the low-proficiency tier  and is ranked just above Thailand in Asia. This year's index has increased the weight of listening tests, while decreasing the importance of grammar and vocabulary exams, which partly caused the ranking change, researchers said. Moreover, test-oriented  and rote-based learning methods often used in China hurt the language skills of Chinese students, education experts said. The study compared test scores of more than 1.7 million adults in the 54 countries and regions. Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands have the best command of English, while Libya has the lowest English proficiency level. European countries generally performed well. But Italy, Spain and Portugal, some of the countries at the heart of the euro zone crisis, are being dragged down by poor English, according to the report.

It is important to know the ways you can use and show them to everyone else in the family, such as stairways and emergency exits, but not elevators. From the lower floors of building, escape through windows is possible. Learn the best way to get out from a window with the least chance of serious injury. The second floor window is usually not very high from the ground. An average person, hanging by the fingertips will have a drop of about 6 feet to the ground. It is about twice the height of an average man. Of course, it is safer to jump a short way down than to stay in a burning building. Windows are also useful when you are waiting for help. Be sure to keep the door closed before opening the window. Otherwise, smoke and fire may be drawn into the room. Keep your head low at the window to be sure you get fresh air rather than smoke that may have leaked into the room. On the second or third floor, the best windows for escape are those which open onto a roof. From the roof a person can drop to the ground more safely. Dropping onto cement might end in injury.

49,"There are some strong-minded people that are able to stop smoking today and be free from the addiction the next day. However, some smokers may have to seek help from medication   in order to kick the habit.      What medication actually does is to reduce the wish to smoke. Some of the medication must be taken with a doctor's guidance. The five most common medications to stop smoking are Bupropion SR, nicotine gum, nicotine inhalers, nicotine nasal spray and nicotine patches. People can buy nicotine gum and nicotine patches in chemists. However, the other medications require a prescription.      Zyban tablets have been found to be highly effective in curing people of smoking addiction. The tablet needs to be taken whole, without crushing  it, as crushing can lead to side effects. It can be bought on the prescription of a doctor.      Nicotine patches are filled with nicotine and they are applied to the skin. The skin takes in the nicotine and carries it to the blood stream. The amount of nicotine in these patches is quite limited, not enough to lead to addiction. But you shouldn't take them for dinner. In fact, millions of people have benefited from these nicotine patches.      Nicotine gum is supposed to be a safer choice. It is used in such a way that it comes into contact with the blood vessels   in the mouth and then releases the nicotine. The nicotine should not go through the stomach; otherwise, it may cause certain side effects.      These different types of medications have to be taken quite carefully. Do ask your doctor before taking any of these. From this passage we can learn that   _  .",a strong-willed smoker must take medication to help stop smoking,one shouldn't break the Zyban tablet into pieces when taking it,nicotine patches can be injected into the blood stream,nicotine gum can be swallowed   like food,B

When the children give it a push and jump in for their first ride, smiles of wonder appears on their faces. The fun of going round and round in a circle is just part of the wonder. The wonderful invention doesn't only change the kids' play time, but also makes a big difference to the people's lives. As the merry-go-round starts, _ pumps clean water up from deep underground and keeps it in a huge tank . People are welcomed to come and help themselves to get the water for free. They are very happy these days. In the countryside of Africa, very few people could drink clean water. They don't have machines that can get water in their homes. Instead, they often walk a long way to carry water back. Patricia Molope, a fifteen-year-old girl, explains that before her village in South Africa got a PlayPump, people would pay a taxi driver to take them to a well far from their homes. "" Sometimes the taxi drivers were so busy that we would have to stop taking showers in order to save water. It was so far to walk there, but at present we have our own clean water in the village, and the life is better, too."" The hard job of carrying water usually is done by women and girls. Carrying water for miles and hours each day is such a heavy job that it sometimes prevents girls from being able to go to school. Thanks to the PlayPump, getting water is quicker and easier-----and even boys join in. The pumps have become a new activity. Kids and adults seem to love playing with them while collecting water. A boy named Khumalo, twelve years old, says, "" I have seen many kinds of water pumps, but have never seen one that can keep water. When I grow up, I want to be an inventor so I can also invent clever things like the PlayPump that will help my country.""

""The great renewal of the Chinese nation requires efforts of one generation after another,"" Xi said in a speech at Tiananmen Square remembering the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in the Pacific. ""Having created an impressive civilization of over 5,000 years, the Chinese civilization will lead to an even brighter future,"" he said. Xi's announcement came as China staged a massive military parade in central Beijing, sending a stream of troops, tanks, and ballistic missiles  down a major east-west street as fighter jets flew overhead with multicolored smoke. Xi's speech kicked off the parade. An estimated 12,000 troops--about 1,000 of whom hailed   from Belarus, Cuba, Tajikistan, and other countries-marched along the 10-lane Chang'an Avenue from the commercial center wangfujing to Tiannmen Square, about 1.5 miles away. They were joined by 200 fighter jets and 500 pieces of military hardware, including tanks and ballistic missiles. Representatives from 49 countries were in attendance, including Russian leader Vladimir Putin, South Korean President Park Geun-hye and U. N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Rory Medcalf, head of the national security college at Australian National University, said the Beijing may have decided to cut 300,000 troops ""in the name of efficiency and cost saving.""

55,"As wild animal lovers are not content with watching tigers and gorillas  during the day, a growing number of zoos in the US are offering a more thrilling after-dark experience -- overnight stays. The Philadelphia Zoo is America's first zoo and home to more than 1,300 animals. It has been running its Roars and Snores Overnight Programs for about 20 years. The most popular theme program is the Night Flight Overnight Program where children aged 5 to 12 sleep in the zoo's tree house. The overnight stays are not only popular with young children. Most overnight stays include a night tour during which youngsters experience the mysterious sights and unusual sounds of the zoo. A midnight snack and breakfast are also served. ""It is a unique experience to be at the zoo without the crowds and additional noise,"" explained Patterson, of the Denver Zoo, which has been running its Bunk with the Beasts program since 1998. With nearly 4,000 animals and 700 species the zoo attracts more than 1.8 million visitors a year. ""The things you hear and see in the zoo are completely different,"" said Patterson. On Denver's two-hour tours, night vision scopes are provided so guests can see nocturnal   animals such as owls, and indoor educational games increase the learning experience. Patterson said parents tend to be more worried about leaving their children than the children themselves. They have rarely had to call up a parent in the middle of the night. ""They love it,"" Patterson said about the children. ""For many, it's their first overnight stay away from home. They are so excited that by the end of the day they are so tired that they have no opportunity to worry."" ""Guests at the new overnight program at the Queens Zoo make breakfast treats for animals, and watch the keepers feed them to the animals,"" said Education Curator Tome Hurtubise.

For the most part, one teacher had to teach all subjects. However, sometimes the headteacher , Mr. Ronald Broaches would come in and spend an hour or so. He was a large man with a very happy nature. He had a sense of humor and would be glad in telling the children small stories which make us laugh. I found that he took great interest in me and he quickly found that I enjoyed puzzles. He would stop me as I was going to class and take a piece of paper out of his pocket, often with a puzzle on it. As time went on, they slowly gave me an interest in math and problem -solving that stays with me to this day. To this day, I can remember Mr. Broaches' cheerful cry of ""Well done!"" whenever I got a problem right. I shall always be thankful that our  paths crossed.

But they are enough reasons for viewers to spend an hour every Friday until June 6 enjoying in front of their television sets. Viewers  have had to wait a long time since A Bite of China 1 came out in 2012. Back then, the seven-episode documentary was considered the best one ever produced by CCTV, with its good effects and rich food culture. A famous foreigner praised it, saying ""it's the best TV show I've ever seen about food. I'm sure it's the best one ever made. "" The new season includes eight episodes, covering 300 types of food. According to CCTV, every minute of the show was edited  out of 150 minutes of footage . Finding their subjects was often the hardest part of the film team's job.

""My grandmothers didn't do anything but keep house and serve everybody.They were programmed to do that,"" said Emily Cornett, head of a of the 7-year-old Red Hat Society. While men have long spent their time fishing and playing golf, women have sometimes seemed to become unnoticed as they age.But the generation now turning 50 is the baby boomers , and the same people who refused their parents' way of being young are now trying a new way of growing old. If you take into consideration feminism , a bit of spare money, and better health for most elderly, the Red Hat Society looks almost inevitable .In this society, women over 50 wear red hats and purple  clothes, while the women under 50 wear pink hats and light purple clothing. ""The organization took the idea from a poem by Jenny Joseph that begins: ""When I am an old woman, I shall wear purple.With a red hat which doesn't go,"" said Ellen Cooper, who founded the Red Hat Society in 1998.When the ladies started to wear the red hats, they attracted lots of attention.

61,"Aimlessness has hardly been typical of the postwar Japan whose productivity and social harmony are the envy of the United States and Europe. But increasingly the Japanese are seeing a decline of the traditional work-moral values. Ten years ago young people were hardworking and saw their jobs as their primary reason for being, but now Japan has largely fulfilled its economic needs, and young people don't know where they should go next. The coming of age of the postwar baby boom and an entry of women into the male-dominated job market have limited the opportunities of teenagers who are already questioning the heavy personal sacrifices involved in climbing Japans rigid social ladder to good schools and jobs. In a recent survey, it was found that only 24.5 percent of Japanese students were fully satisfied with school life, compared with 67.2 percent of students in the United States. In addition, far more Japanese workers expressed dissatisfaction with their jobs than their counterparts did in the ten other countries surveyed. While often praised by foreigners for its emphasis on the basics, Japanese education tends to stress test taking and mechanical learning over creativity and self-expression."" Those things that do not show up in the test scores, personality, ability, courage or humanity are completely ignored,"" says Toshiki Kaifu, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's education committee."" Frustration against this kind of thing leads kids to drop out and run wild."" Last year Japan experienced 2,125 incidents of school violence, including 929 assaults on teachers. Amid the outcry, many conservative leaders are seeking a return to the prewar emphasis on moral education. Last year Mitsuo Setoyama, who was then education minister, raised eyebrows when he argued that liberal reforms introduced by the American occupation authorities after World WarII had weakened the ""Japanese morality of respect for parents."" But that may have more to do with Japanese life-styles."" In Japan,"" says educator Yoko Muro, ""it's never a question of whether you enjoy your job and your life, but only how much you can endure."" With economic growth becoming centralization, fully 76 percent of Japans, 119 million citizens live in cities where community and the extended family have been abandoned in favor of isolated, two generation households. Urban Japanese have long endured lengthy commutes (travels to and from work) and crowded living conditions, but as the old group and family values weaken, the discomfort is beginning to tell. In the past decade, the Japanese divorce rate, while still well below that of the United States, has increased by more than 50 percent, and suicides have increased by nearly one-quarter.

68,"Entire populations of American toads breed within the same few days at the same time each year, usually late April or early May. The toads hop to their breeding ponds after the ground has warmed and the first hard spring rain falls. To get there, many of the toads will cross roads that cut through their habitat. It will be a grand view of hopping toads as well as a disastrous killing by cars! The toads are ""slow in moving at that time of year--it's still cool, they've been inactive--and they get killed"" by cars when crossing roads, said Serrao, a naturalist. An April night five years ago, when Serrao went out to a country road to watch the moving of the toads, he counted 100 toads; 95 were hit by cars.  A similar story can be told for several other species of toads, frogs, crocodiles and turtles around the world.  The world's amphibians are reducing, and road-killing is just one factor behind it. Other better-known causes of the decline include global warming, insecticides , and the loss of wetlands.  Serrao says unless these animals get help crossing the road, their local populations will disappear.  Jackson, a biologist, said one way to help amphibians survive road crossings is to construct ""amphibian tunnels"" beneath the road. Jackson says tunnels should be a 0.6-meter-by-0.6-meter box, open at the top, and fitted with an iron grate to allow enough air and light into the tunnel. In addition, fences or walls should extend out from either side of a tunnel for about 30 meters, which guide amphibians toward the tunnels.  European countries have built amphibian tunnels for decades. Jackson led a team that installed the first such tunnel in prefix = st1 /Americain 1987, which helped over 3/4 of the local amphibian population safely cross the road. Jackson says that there are about a hundred amphibian tunnels in the UStoday, but many of them were not carefully designed and probably not working well because land developers wanted to save money. Which of the following is true?",Toads are active when they begin their breeding migration.,A toad tunnel works effectively with a grate to let in air and light.,Amphibian tunnels were first built in America.,One hundred amphibian tunnels in the USwork well,B
69,"At Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, the lights are controlled by sensors that measure sunlight. They dim immediately when it's sunny and brighten when a passing cloud blocks the sun. A wall of windows at a University of Pennsylvania engineering building has built-in blinds   controlled by a computer program that follows the sun's path. Buildings are getting smarter and the next generation of building materials is expected to do even more. Windows could catch the sun's energy to heat water. Sensors that measure the carbon dioxide breathed out by people in a room could determine whether the air conditioning needs to be turned up. Many new materials and technology have been designed in the last 15 years. They are now being used in a wave of buildings designed to save as much energy as possible. They include old ideas, like ""green roofs"", where a belt of plants on a roof helps the building keep heat in winter and stay cool in summer, and new ideas, like special coating for windows that lets light in, but keeps heat out. As technologies such as sensors become cheaper, their uses spread. The elevators at Seven World Trade Center, which is under construction in New York, use a system that groups people traveling to nearby floors into the same elevator, thus saving elevator stops. People who work in the building will enter it by swiping   ID cards that will tell the elevators their floor, readouts will then tell them which elevator to use. The building also has windows with a coating that blocks heat while letting in light. More new building materials and technology are in development. A Philadelphia building firm is now working on ""smart wrap"" that uses tiny solar collectors to catch the sun's energy and transmitters   as wide as a human hair to move it. They are expected to change the face of the construction industry in the next ten years or so.

70,"Each day water-related diseases kill 3,900 of the world's children. Across the world, 1.1 billion people have no access to clean drinking water. More than 2.6 billion people lack basic sanitation  . The combination proves deadly. Each year, diseases related to inadequate water and sanitation kill between 2 and 5 million people and cause an estimated 80 percent of all sicknesses in the developing world. Safe drinking water is a precondition for health and the fight against child death rate, inequality between men and women, and poverty. Consider these facts: * The average distance that women in Africa and Asia walk to collect water is 6 kilometres. * Only 58 percent of children in sub-Sharan Africa are drinking safe water, and only 37 percent of children in South Asia have access to even a basic toilet. * Each year in India alone, 73 million working days are lost to water-borne diseases. Here are three ways you can help: 1) Write Congress Current U.S. foreign aid for drinking water and sanitation budgets only one dollar per year per American citizen. Few members of Congress have ever received a letter from voters about clean drinking water abroad. 2) Sponsor a project with a faith-based organization Many U.S. religious groups already sponsor water and sanitation projects, working with partner organizations can make safe water a reality for thousands of people. 3) Support nonprofit water organizations Numerous U.S. based nonprofits work skillfully abroad in community led projects related to drinking water and sanitation.

71,"The word ""death"" is a word many Chinese friends tell me I should not say aloud. They advise me to avoid the word because only speaking of it may bring ill fortune. I deeply believe, however, that to know how to live, we must also know how to die. The problem is how we talk about death. Like everyone in Taiwan this week, I have had ""Tomb Sweeping Day"". I am proud to be part of a people whose culture sends millions of families to cemeteries on this special day to share memories and endless love. Today, eight days after the death of Pope John Paul II, millions of people of all backgrounds still grieve  his passing away. He was a deeply human person who knew how to laugh and show emotions, a writer with a gift for words a leader who appealed to us by the sheer light of his love for life. On the same day and only hours before the Holy Father left us, a friend of mine named Veronica McBride died of cancer in a small Wisconsin city. My friend Veronica was 52 years old. She was an attractive, humorous young woman who, as the saying goes, ""never married"". She published several humor books with her mother, Mary McBride. She enjoyed traveling, and for years sent Christmas card photos of herself standing beside monuments or odd animals. She fought cancer for five years. She joked about her treatment keeping her pretty because it kept her thin, and told me she didn't mind losing her hair because of . ""I get to wear nice wigs!"" The last time I saw Veronica was when I visited her family on a sunny day in August in 2003. When she burst into the front door later and saw me in the living room, she ignored me completely in her hurry to hug her newest baby nephew, leaving me shaking my head in laughter at her. As we look to the significance of the Holy Father and his life, surely we must also keep our eyes open to see the wonder and goodness in ordinary people who show us how to live and how to die. The purpose of the article is    _   .",to memorize his friend Veronica,to talk about the significance of life and death,to teach us how to face life and death,to compare his friend and the Holy Father Pope John Paul II,C
72,"On Easter Day, 1722, Dutch explorers   landed on Easter Island  . It was the first time that Easter Islanders had met people from the outside world. The strangers were about to discover something very strange themselves --that they were on an island with hundreds of huge stone statues  . The Dutch explorers wondered where the Islanders had come from and why and how they had built the statues. Now science is putting together the story.     The first people to arrive on the island came there around A.D. 700. The society that developed there was based on fishing and farming to feed the population, which grew to 12,000. Its success showed itself in a way that has become the island's trademark  : hundreds of huge stone figures --the moai.     None of the moai was standing when scientists first arrived. People put them back up later; but how had a Stone Age society ever made, moved and set them up there in the first place? And why?     There are nearly 900 moai on Easter Island, and while the questions about them remain unanswered, no one doubts the years of effort that must have gone into making them.     The real killer of the Easter Islanders came from across the ocean. After 1722, it became popular for explorers to visit Easter Island, bringing diseases. The final blow   came in 1862, when slave traders came from Peru and took away 1,500 people, one-third of the population. The passage implies that   _  .",the Islanders built the moai to show off their success,the Dutch explorers discovered how the moai had been built,"in 1862, before slave traders came, about 4,500 people were living on Easter Island","the natives of Easter Island have been there for about 1,200 years",C

75,"In a development that would have seemed hardly possible just over a decade ago, many of us have gained constant access to information. If we need to find out the score of a ballgame, learn how to perform a complicated mathematical task, or simply remember the name of the actress in the movie we are viewing, we need only turn to our laptops or smart phones and we can find the answers immediately. It has become such an ordinary practice to look up the answer to any question the moment it occurs. It can feel like going through withdrawal when we can't find out something immediately. We are seldom offline unless by choice and the Internet, with its search engines like Baidu and Google and the information stored there, has become an external  memory source that we can access at any time. Storing information externally is nothing particularly new, even before the invention of computers. In any group relationship, people typically develop a transactive  memory, which is a combination of memory stores held directly by individuals and the memory stores they can access because they are in touch with someone who knows that information. Like linked computers that can address each other's memories, people in groups form transactive memory systems. In a recent research led by Besty Sparrow of Columbia University, researchers have explored whether having online access to search engines has become a primary transactive memory source in itself. If asked the question whether there are any countries with only one color1 in their flag, for example,do we think about flagsor immediately think to go online to find out the answer? In one experiment,the participants were asked to read 40 memorable unimportant statements of the type that they could look up online (e. g.,an ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain). Then they were asked to type the statements into computer to assure memory. Half the participants believed the computer would save what was typed and the other half believed the item would be erased. After the reading and typing task, participants wrote down as many of the statements as they could remember.  It turned out that participants who believed the computer would erase what they had typed had better recall than those who regarded the computer as the memory source. The Internet has become a primary form of transactive memory , and processes of human memory are adapting to the new computing and communication technology. Just as we learn through transactive memory who knows what in our families and offices, we are learning what the computer ""knows"" and when we should attend to where we have stored information in our computer-based memories. The importance of the information from the Internet is almost equal to that of all the knowledge we gain from our friends and coworkers--and lose if they are out of touch. The experience of losing our Internet connection becomes more and more like losing a friend. We must always remain plugged in to know what the Internet knows. What can we learn from the passage?",Transactive memory is essential to the development of mankind.,Search engines make us more curious and enthusiastic about new information.,The Internet is the most important form of transactive memory.,Changes in our memory processes serve as an adaptation to new technology.,D

77,"For Americans, a mosquito bite is an itchy bother. But for many in Africa, a tiny bite can be deadly. One million people die each year of malaria, a disease spread by infected mosquitoes. Most of these people live in Africa, and are under age 5. Malaria can be prevented and treated. However, many African nations don't have the funds to fight it. Nothing but Nets (NBN) hopes to change that. The United Nations Foundation created the campaign in 2006. The aim is to prevent malaria by covering sleeping areas with nets. Hanging bed nets treated with insecticide  is the simplest way to stop mosquitoes from biting at night. The chemicals last four to five years. For $10, anyone can send a net to Africa and help save a life. So far, NBN has raised $19 million and delivered 700,000 nets to seven countries. Families are taught how to use the nets. Kids also get vaccines  and vitamins. ""Women line up for miles to get the medicine for their kids,"" says NBN director Elizabeth McKee Gore. ""They understand the importance."" So do kids in this country. ""They get so excited thinking of ways to raise money,"" says NBN spokesperson and basketball star Ruth Riley. NBN's biggest fund-raiser is Katherine Commale, 7. She's been spreading the information about bed nets for the past two years. To show how they work, she and her brother made a video. ""We teach that bed nets can save lives,"" she said. Katherine has raised $42,000 for NBN. ""She just wants those who need a net to have one,"" says her mom, Lynda. ""It's pretty simple to her."" To find out how you can help, visit nothingbutnets.net.

Most people worldwide (including 80 percent of all Africans)rely on herbal medicines which are got mostly from wild plants.But some 15,000 of the 50,000 medicinal species are under threat of dying out,according to a report from the international conversation group Plantlife.Shortages have been reported in China,India,Kenya,Nepal,Tanzania and Uganda. Overharvesting does the most harm,though pollution and competition from invasive species are both responsible.""Businessmen generally harvest medicinal plants,not caring about sustain ability,""the Plantlife report says.""Damage is serious partly because they have no idea of it,but it is mainly because such collection is unorganized."" Medicinal trees at risk include the Himalayan yew and the African cherry,which are used to treat some cancers. The solution,says the report's author,Alan Hamilton,is to encourage local people to protect these plants.Ten projects studied by Plantlife in India,Pakistan,China,Nepal,Uganda and Kenya showed this method can succeed.In Uganda the project has kept a sustainable supply of lowcost cancer treatments,and in China a public run medicinal plant project has been created for the first time.

80,"Europe's deadly outbreak of a rare form of E. coli bacteria   has brought new attention to food safety issues. One of the problems when people get sick from food is that the simplest question is often difficult or even impossible to answer. Just what did the people eat that made them sick? Of course, one way to avoid these medical mysteries is to keep dangerous organisms out of the food supply. This is easier said than done, but scientists keep looking for new ways. Scientists in the United States have developed an experimental system that uses a high-tech optical scanner. The system is designed to identify the presence of contaminants  like soil or animal waste on fresh produce. These can be sources of E. coli. E. coli bacteria naturally live in the intestines  of humans and many animals. Most kinds of E. coli are harmless but some can make people sick. The new scanner can also show damage and imperfections that might make the produce unappealing to shoppers. Scientists designed the system at a Department of Agriculture research center in Beltsville, Maryland. Moon Kim of the Agricultural Research Service led the team. MOON KIM: ""We were requested, we were asked, to develop a method to detect contamination in produce. So we started with the apple as the model sample."" The scanner uses a high-speed camera placed over the conveyer belt that moves the produce along. As the apples move along the belt, the scanner captures images of each piece of fruit. Moon Kim says the team hopes the system will be available before long. MOON KIM: ""We are targeting for development in commercial plants for the next several years."" The scanner can direct a sorting machine to separate the bad apples from the good ones. The system is currently able to show the surface of only half the apple as it speeds by. The inventers hope to improve the process so it can show the whole surface. What is the main topic of the text?",Bacteria.,A high-tech scanner.,A camera,Food safety.,B
81,"Watercolour is the oldest paints known. It dates back to the early cave men who discovered they could add lifelike qualities to drawings of animals and other figures on the walls of caves by mixing the natural colours found in the earth with water. Fresco  , one of the greatest of all art forms, is done with watercolour. It is created by mixing paints and water and applying these to wet plaster  . Of the thousands of people who stand under Michelangelo's heroic ceiling in the Sistine Chapel, very few know that they are looking at perhaps the greatest watercolour painting in the world. The invention of oil painting by the Flemish masters in the fifteenth century made fresco painting go down-hill, and for the next several centuries watercolour was used mainly for doing sketches   or as a tool for study. It was not until the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that English painters put back watercolour as a serious art form. The English have a widely-known love for outdoors and also small private pictures. The softness of watercolour had a remarkably strong attraction for them. The popularity of watercolour continued to grow until the twentieth century.

89,"Few, if any, instruments shape national culture more powerfully than the materials used in schools. Textbooks are not only among the first books most people meet; in many places they are, along with religious texts, almost the only books they have.

In 2010 a study by Egypt's government found that, apart from school textbooks, 88% of Egyptian households read no books.               The degree to which a government keeps control of the textbooks used in classrooms is a good guide to its commitment to ideological  control. Where that desire is strong, governments are likely to produce the textbooks themselves or define carefully what goes into them.               America's State Department employs people to keep an eye on other countries' textbooks, in an effort to understand better how their people think and what their governments want them to think. Other countries probably do the same.               Textbooks have long been a source of worry. After the attacks on America on September 11th 2001, some in both America and Saudi Arabia, including officials, supposed that Saudi Arabia's curriculum of intolerance was responsible, at least in part, for the emergence of al-Qaeda  .                Sometimes the requirements of the state are more clearly seen in what textbooks leave out. The world has long criticized Japan for the way its textbooks whitewash the country's history, in particular dressing up Japanese war crimes. The ""New History Textbook"", for example, which was submitted for government approval in 2000, played down Japan's aggression in the Sino-Japanese war of 1894-95 and the occupation of China in the 1930s and 1940s, and avoided mention of the use of sex slaves by its armies or the rape of Nanjing.  In America most of the disputes about textbooks are home-grown. Liberals worry that their children are being taught a nationalistic version of history that emphasizes the wonders of industrialization and plays down slavery and the killing of Indian tribes. By contrast, Conservatives complain about inadequate education of love for their country and too much secularism  . In 2010 the Texas board of education managed to remove Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, from the state's list of important revolutionary figures, apparently because of Jefferson's insistence on the separation of church and state. He was, however, swiftly restored.               As long as textbooks are issued or approved by the state, they will remain a political issue. But as access to other textbooks is enjoyed more widely, some of the dominance they now enjoy will weaken. While talking about textbooks, the author seems to think that_.",they should be controlled by the government,home-grown disputes are easier to settle,they should be a political issue,they are not necessarily so,D

91,"With a PS4 million ITV contract  in her pocket and an engagement   to her England footballer boyfriend, it's been a good year for Christine Bleakley.Perhaps it's no wonder, as the TV presenter is 31, the age at which women are the most attractive, according to a survey. While the average British woman of 31 may be married with a child, the survey noted they are at a wonderful age because they have not only youthful beauty but also more confidence and a better sense of style than flesh-faced teenagers. Some 70 percent of more than 2,000 men and women surveyed considered confidence as a key factor in making a woman attractive, ahead of the 67 percent who included physical beauty and 47 percent who looked for a sense of style.Almost two thirds of the women agreed with the opinion ""With age, comes beauty"", and over half said that as they age they do away with their insecurities and feel more beautiful, while 55 percent felt they knew the best make-up to wear. Self-confidence varied widely across the country in the survey: London women emerged as the most confident about their looks, with 37 percent describing themselves as beautiful, compared with just 28 percent of Welsh women.Meanwhile, East Midlands women spend the most on beauty programs --PS129.69 monthly--compared with a national average of PS105.50. The research was carried on for TV shopping channel QVC to mark the launch of its ""Beauty Month"".QVC marketing director Sue Leeson said: ""This research shows what many have always suspected -- real beauty is about more than just good looks but a combination of confidence, style and personality, too.""

93,"Suppose you are thinking about attending college in the United States, but perhaps you might not be ready for a university with a four-year program. About 88,000 international students have found solution. They are attending U.S. community colleges. Such colleges are sometimes called junior colleges. They offer two years of education above the secondary or high school level. Community college students can choose from subjects like medical assistance, computer science or law. At the end of their study program, they receive a document of completion, called a certificate. Some students work toward an associate degree in traditional academic subjects like science or history. After getting it, the students can move on to a four-year college or university. They may have only two years of study left before they receive a bachelor's degree. Many educational experts agree that saving money is the major reason to consider a community college. The American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) says that a public two-year college costs 3,000 dollar a year on average. That is true if the student lives in the same state as the school. A student at a four-year public college may pay 8,500 dollars a year for classes and user fees. That does not include books and other materials. Some international students may need more preparation in English before entering a community college in the United States. For example, Istrif Montgomery came to the U.S. from Kosovo in 2006. First, he worked to improve his English at Montgomery College for a year. Then for the next two years, he attended classes in basic subjects in a community college. The international students at two-year colleges need to find a place to live. Most community colleges do not provide student housing on their grounds. But Mr Montgomery had a home nearby. He was able to ride the bicycle, and he was able to walk if he wanted. In fact, most community college students live within five to ten miles off the college.

At the end of the first year at the university, this young student came home. He wanted a change. And he also wanted to tell his parents about Oxford. It happened one night when the father, the mother and the young student were sit- ting at supper. They had in front of them only two chickens. Just as they were about to begin eating, the father said, ""My boy, I have spent a lot of money on you to send you to Oxford. Now I want to know what you have learned."" The son smiled and said, ""Father, I have studied a science which can _ that these two chickens on the plate are really three chickens."" ""Well,"" said the father, ""This is something I would like very much to know."" ""There are two chickens on the plate,"" said the student. He took one of the chickens in his hand and said, ""Here is one more; and one and two makes three. So here are three chickens."" Then the father took one of the chickens to him-self, gave the other to his wife, and said,""I shall have one of the chickens myself, your mother will have another, and you can have the third for your supper and nothing else.""

95,"Nuclearpowered aircraft carriers are considered one of the most important marine weapons in the 20th century. So far, only two countries in the world, the USA and France, have ever produced them. But these fearful fighting machines are about to enter Asia. The US Navy said last month that one of its nine nuclearpowered aircraft carriers will be sent to Japan to replace the diesel powered carrier Kitty Hawk in 2008. In an agreement on October 30, the two countries also planned to level up their military   cooperation and the USA called for Japan to take a larger role in alliance  military moves. It will be the first time that a nuclearpowered carrier is based in Japan. Bombed by US forces in World War II at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan is the only world country to have been attacked by a nuclear weapon. Therefore, the citizens are highly sensitive to where nuclearpowered weapons are based. ""A radiation leak at Yokosuka would kill 100,000 people as far away as Tokyo, and could cause billions of dollars in damage,"" said Masahiko Goto, leader of a protest group in Yokosuka. His group has collected more than 300,000 signatures of people across Japan opposed to the nuclear carrier. The 44yearold Kitty Hawk, the US Navy's oldest active ship, has been based in Yokosuka since 1998. It had returned to the US to be decommissioned  in 2008. The new carrier will travel faster, be capable of supporting longer operations and carry with it the Navy's most modern technology. Experts pointed that this change is not only to strengthen the USJapan military alliance but also to keep the military power of China and North Korea within limits. However, even Japanese experts don't believe that the two countries are threats to the region. ""There is no need for Japan to have a nuclear carrier as defense,"" said Tetsuo Maeda, an international relations professor at Tokyo International University. He said that the change of ship indicates an increased military capability in the region, much more than what is needed. From the story, we learn that  _  .",no other countries except the USA and France possess aircraft carriers,Japan has long planned to increase its military capability with new weapons,Japan will be the first country in Asia to have a nuclear aircraft carrier,Japan will be the third country to produce a nuclearpowered aircraft carrier,C

Belgium has the highest income tax rate, at nearly 56 percent of income, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. Taxpayers in the U.S. pay less than 36 percent of their incomes into the national treasury. Taxes pay for services provided by the government. The U.S. ranks 25 of the 34 developed countries polled in the report. An unmarried person with no children was used as an example in the report. In America, an unmarried person, with no children, making the average wage of $50,000 in 2014 paid 24.8 percent of their income in federal   income tax and payroll taxes  . A similar person living in Belgium would pay 42.3 percent of their income. The average among the 39 countries in the poll was 27.3 percent income tax. The deadline to pay taxes in America is usually April 15. This year, the deadline is April 18. American taxpayers complain that wealthy people and large companies pay too little tax, according to a Pew Research Center poll from 2015. Americans pay tax to fund programs like Social Security and Medicaid, according to the Pew Research Center. Last year, American taxes paid for $888 billion in Social Security benefits. Social Security pays the elderly an income after they stop working. The government also paid more than $546 billion in Medicaid and Medicare benefits.

98,"Treatment for HIV has become more widespread, especially in poorer countries. It's also become cheaper, as medicine companies have lowered their prices for life-saving anti-retroviral drugs . But these drugs are still expensive and many countries are looking to create the biggest impact with limited resources. That's where World Health Organization guidelines come in, says Rochelle Walensky, a disease researcher from Harvard. Walensky and her colleagues used computer programs to model the most cost-effective disease interventions , as well as collected data from clinics in Africa and India about what works best. They found that among the choices of what to do first, earlier anti-retroviral therapy  improved five-year survival dramatically and resulted in the longer life expectancy. But cost-effective doesn't always mean affordable, especially for governments in poor countries. Countries still have to make difficult choices about how much treatment they can afford. People in Nairobi, Kenya on Thursday, Dec. 9, 2010, protest a potential free trade area agreement between the EU and India that could see cheap anti-AIDS drugs phased out . However, Walensky notes that first-line anti-retrovirals--those medicine given to newly diagnosed patients that can keep away from symptoms for years - are much cheaper than they were a decade ago. ""Second-line therapy have come down quite a bit but not to the level of first-line and countries are having a hard time affording them and increasingly over time, people are going to fail first-line therapy and they're going second-line therapy and then, eventually, they're going to need third-line therapy, some of them."" According to Walensky, history has shown that drug prices can come down when international pressure is applied to drug makers.

99,"It is reported that conservation groups in North America have been arguing about the benefits and dangers of wolves. Some groups believe wolves should be killed. Other people believe wolves must be protected so that they will not disappear from the wilderness   For Killing Wolves In Alaska,the wolf almost disappeared a few years ago,because hunters were killing hundreds of them for sport. However.1aws were established to protect the wolves from sportsmen and people who catch the animals for their fur.So the wolf population has greatly increased. Now there are so many wolves that they are destroying their own food supply. A wolf naturally eats animals in the deer family. People in the wilderness also hunt deer for food.Many of the animals have been destroyed by the very cold winters recently and by changes in the wilderness plant life.When the deer can't find enough food,they die. If the wolves continue to kill large numbers of deer,their prey will disappear some day.And the wolves will.too.So we must change the cycle of life in the wilderness to balance the ecology.If we killed more wolves,we would save them and their prey from dying out.We'd also  save some farm animals. In another northern state,wolves attack cows and chickens for food.Farmers want the  government to send biologists to study the problem.They believe it necessary to kill wolves in some areas and to protect them in places where there is a small wolf population. Against Killing Wolves If you had lived long ago,you would have heard many different stories about the dangerous  wolf.According to most stories,hungry wolves often kill people for food.Even today,the stories of the ""big bad wolf'""will not disappear. But the fact is wolves are afraid of people.and they seldom travel in areas where there is a human smell.When wolves eat other animals,they usually kill the very young.or the sick and injured .The strongest survive .No kind of animal would have survived through the centuries if the weak members had lived.And has always been a law of nature. Although some people say it is good sense to kill wolves,we say it is nonsense! Researchers  have found wolves and their prey living in balance.The wolves keep the deer population from  becoming too large, and that keeps a balance in the wilderness plant life. The real problem is that the areas where wolves can live are being used by people.Even if wilderness land is not used directly for human needs.the wolves can't always find enough food .So they travel to the nearest source, which is often a farm.Then there is danger.The ""big bad wolf"" has arrived! And everyone knows what happens next.

Many people aren't conditioned to the physical stress of outdoor activities and don't know the dangers of being outdoors in cold weather. Those who like winter sports can suffer accidental hypothermia if they don't make certain preparations. Hypothermia means the body temperature has fallen below normal. It occurs when your body can't produce enough energy to keep the internal   body temperature warm enough. It can kill you. Heart failure causes most deaths in hypothermia. Children, the elderly and those with heart disease are at special risk. As people age, their ability to keep a normal internal body temperature often decreases. Elderly people can suffer hypothermia without knowing they're in danger because they can't notice the cold conditions as quickly as the young. Besides cold temperatures, high winds, snow and rain can also steal body heat. Wind is especially dangerous because it removes the layer of heated air from around your body. At 30 degrees Fahrenheit in a 20-mile-per-hour wind, the cooling effect is equal to calm air at four degrees. Similarly dampness   causes the body to lose heat faster than it would at the same temperature in drier conditions. To keep warm, wear more clothes. This traps air between layers. Also, wear a hat or head scarf. Much of your body's heat can be lost through your head. Keep your hands and feet warm, too, as they tend to lose heat rapidly. Don't drink alcohol before going outdoors or when outside. Alcohol makes you feel warm at first because blood vessels in the skin expand. But heat is then drawn away from the body's important organs. Which of the following is NOT a result of drinking alcohol before going outdoors?",Feeling warm at first,The body's heat is taken away,Blood vessels in the skin expand,The risk of hypothermia is reduced,D

102,"A recent National Public Radio program examined the disappearance of some of the first words we were probably taught - ""please"" and ""thank you."" Other polite phrases are also disappearing. ""You're welcome"" has been replaced by ""sure,"" ""no problem,"" ""you bet"" or ""enjoy.""   Are we becoming ruder, or are patterns of speech merely updating for changing times?   Peter Post, director of the program, argues about people stopping using ""you're welcome"". He says, ""Thank you"" is an expression of appreciation one person offers another. To respond ""No problem"" is to ignore this acceptance as really being undeserved. By responding with a simple ""you're welcome,"" Post adds, a person admits the thanks and shows appreciation for the person giving it.   Whatever polite vocabulary you believe is fading, sociologist Gregory E. Smith says that such fading is a sign that we're becoming ruder as a society. ""Saying please and thank you, asking permission, offering help, and following up on solutions to problems are no longer as important,"" he says. In 2011, 76 percent of people surveyed said Americans are becoming less civil.   But could it be that it's simply the words we're using that are changing? Actually, the principles of respect, consideration and honesty are universal and timeless, but manners do change. For example, it's important to greet people when you see them, though the form of greeting has changed over time. ""How do you do,"" for instance, became ""Hello, how are you?"" which changed into ""Hello, how are things,"" or ""How's it going?"". As for ""no problem"", if the appreciation is expressed in a sincere manner, many Americans think they do not see its use as a loss of politeness. Peter Post thinks using ""You're welcome"" to reply to ""Thank you"" is   _  .",more appropriate,a bit outdated,less polite,really undeserved,A

Our biggest enemies are not terrible diseases. We are our own biggest enemies because we sometimes destroy our own good health. Some of us eat too much, drink too much and smoke too much. And though our reason tells us we should control ourselves, we find it difficult. The fact is that most human beings need stimulation.  Who doesn't enjoy a drink after a busy day? Only a smoker knows the pleasure of a cigarette with a cup of coffee.  The danger is when these innocent pleasures run our lives and so destroy our health.

108,"Packaging is an important form of advertising.A package can sometimes _ someone to buy a product.For example, a small child might ask for a breakfast food that comes in a box with a picture of a TV character.The child is more interested in the picture than in breakfast food.Pictures for children to color or cut out, games printed on a package, or a small gift inside a box also motivate many children to buy products or to ask their parents to buy for them. Some packages suggest that a buyer will get something for nothing.Food products sold in reusable containers are examples of this.Although a similar product in a plain container might cost less, people often prefer to buy the product in a reusable glass or dish, because they believe the container is free.However, the cost of the container is added to the cost of the product.The size of a package also motivates a buyer.Maybe the package had ""Economy Size"" or ""Family Size"" printed on it.This suggests that the larger size has the most product for the least money.But that is not always true.To find it out, a buyer has to know how the product is sold and the price of the basic unit. The information on the package should provide some answers.But the important thing for any buyer to remember is that a package is often an advertisement.The words and pictures do not tell the whole story.Only the product inside can do that.

113,"On countless mornings over the past year, I stood with my son, James, in our driveway, watching our neighbor hurry off to kindergarten.My wife and I wanted to give James the best  education, but that meant we'd have to change our jobs and spend less time with our kid.I asked myself, ""Would this trade-off be worth it?"" When I look at the research on child development, I think it might not.Where our kids go to school might matter less than most American parents think. Social scientists have long tried to determine why some children grow up to be successful.In a 2001 study, Greg Duncan, a professor of education at the University of California, measured the influence that the people in a child's life have on how well the child does in school.Duncan and his team found almost no relationship between how students did on the test and whom they sat beside in class, whom they hung out with after school and who lived in their block.The only meaningful link they found was between siblings   and twins in particular. For a long time, scholars thought that a family's income heavily affected how well kids did   in life.But that might not be the case.When Susan Mayer at the University of Chicago looked at the relationship between family income and lifetime achievement, she ran a series of experiments to measure it, finding such outcomes weren't caused by income.She argued that the things that make a difference are relatively inexpensive: the number of books a kid has or how often his family goes to museums. Lareau, another scholar began one of the most in-depth observations of American parenting.He concluded that success is much more related to the amount of time parents spend with their children.He said ""Many parents I interviewed are anxious about their children's futures.But they have exaggerated  the sense of the risks involved if they don't give their children 'the best' of everything."" So at last, we decided to leave things as it were.More time with our kid is the best we can provide. From the passage we know that most American parents   _  .",spend a lot of time with their children,like to buy a variety of books for their children,think children's achievement largely depends on schools,believe their income cannot afford children's education,C

115,"My mother has always instilled in me the importance of education. Education is essential. It will help me get accepted to college if I perform well academically and advance my opportunities for success in the future. Most jobs now require at least a high school diploma, and for many jobs, a college degree is preferred. It is important that all students have excellent educators in their life to help them achieve and have the opportunity to go to college, get a job, support themselves and their family, and impact the community. As we celebrate and honor all teachers during Teacher Appreciation Week, I've reflected on the impact my teachers have had, and will continue to have, in my life. From Mr. Bowker, who challenged me in math, to Mr. Bernsteen, my health teacher who taught me the value of hard work, my teachers have helped shape the student I am today. But one of the teachers who left a lasting impression on me was my summer school teacher, Mr. Davis, who impacted me beyond the classroom. He found time to connect with me on a personal level and talk to me after class. I felt like Mr. Davis cared about my academic success and was committed to setting an example of what's possible. Mr. Davis could relate to what it was like to be a rising ninth-grade black male in today's society. He taught me how to speak up confidently and share my ideas with others. He told me that I was brilliant and that when I spoke, the world should listen. And when I would put my hand down because I was unsure of my answer, Mr. Davis would immediately say, ""No _ , no glory."" He never made me feel inadequate; he encouraged me to always pursue knowledge because he, too, was learning every day. Mr. Davis helped me navigate the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities. I think having more black male teachers like Mr. Davis in the classroom could increase student success. They would share the background and experiences of many of their students and help build long-lasting teacher/student relationships. But, unfortunately, the likelihood that students of color in Nevada will have a teacher that looks like them is one of the lowest in the country. As the student population becomes more ethnically diverse, teachers in Nevada still are predominantly white. According to a 2012 Education Week report, in the Clark County School District, nearly 70 percent of students identified as students of color, but 76 percent of teachers were white. The numbers for black male teachers are more discouraging. Just 2 percent of teachers nationwide are black men. But you can help change the numbers. Whether you decide to study education in college or graduate school, or apply to programs in Las Vegas such as Teach For America, I hope more black males will consider teaching as a career. My peers and I need more examples of excellence and success in classrooms--examples who look like us. You can be the model to impact our life and push us to achieve. You can ensure that, when we look to the front of the room, we can see a little bit of ourselves reflected back.

116,"There have always been a lot of commonly believed but false  ideas about being fat and doing exercise. Some people believe that they can't help putting an weight as they get older, while others hold that if they stop exercising, their muscles  will turn into fat. Here are some more myths. I'll never lose weight--I come from a fat family Wrong! While we can't change the body type we are born with, we can't blame our genes  for making us fat. There's plenty of evidence that fatness runs in families, and the main reason is that they share the same habit of eating too much and exercise too little. I am fat because I burn calories slowly Wrong! Fatness is not caused by a slow metabolism . In fact, although fat people consume   more energy than slim people, they also fail to realize how much they eat. Keeping a diary can help you work out your daily food intake more accurately . Exercise is boring Wrong! Anything will become boring if you do it again and again. The key is to develop a balanced and varied  program that's fun as well as progressive . If you enjoy a Sunday walk, take a different mute. If you do yoga , try a tai chi class. No pain, no gain Wrong! Exercise is not meant to hurt. Indeed, pain is your body telling you something's wrong, and continuing to exercise could lead to serious injury . You may experience mild discomfort as you begin to exercise regularly, but this is your body _ the positive changes in your lifestyle and the aches should disappear quickly. If they don't, rest and ask for medical advice.

There is one disabled person in every 20 Chinese, and one out of every five households on average has a disabled family member. According to nationwide surveys of the disabled children under 14 account for 16 percent of the total disabled population, and they display the greatest need for rehabilitative training as they display the highest recovery rates after early treatment. Those disabled between the ages of 15 and 59 account for 44 percent, but often their disabilities are not very serious. Although they are more or less able to work, they require vocational training, cultural education and special employment. The disabled over 60 years of age account for 40 percent. Many of them become disabled due to illness or loss of various functions. Some live alone without any income, and therefore their insurance, rehabilitation, and medical needs have become a social issue.

118,"In the 19th century, there used to be a model of how to be a good person. There are all these torrents of passion flowing through you. Your job, as captain of your soul, is to erect dams to keep these passions in check. Your job is to just say no to laziness, lust, greed, drug use and the other sins. These days that model is out of fashion. You usually can't change your behavior by simply resolving to do something. Knowing what to do is not the same as being able to do it. Your willpower is not like a dam that can block the torrent of self-indulgence. It's more like a muscle, which tires easily. Moreover, you're a social being. If everybody around you is overeating, you'll probably do so, too. The 19th-century character model was based on an understanding of free will. Today, we know that free will is bounded. People can change their lives, but ordering change is not simple because many things, even within ourselves, are beyond our direct control. Much of our behavior, for example, is guided by unconscious habits. Researchers at Duke University calculated that more than 40 percent of the actions we take are governed by habit, not actual decisions. Researchers have also come to understand the structure of habits--cue, routine, reward. You can change your own personal habits. If you leave running shorts on the floor at night, that'll be a cue to go running in the morning. Don't try to ignore your afternoon snack craving. Every time you feel the cue for a snack, insert another routine. Take a walk. Their research thus implies a different character model, which is supposed to manipulate the neuralnetworks inside. To be an effective person, under this model, you are supposed to coolly examine your own unconscious habits, and the habits of those under your care. You are supposed to devise strategies to alter the cues and routines. Every relationship becomes slightly manipulative, including your relationship with yourself. You're trying to arouse certain responses by implanting certain cues. This is a bit disturbing, because the important habitual neural networks are not formed by mere routine, nor can they be reversed by clever cues. They are burned in by emotion and strengthened by strong yearnings, like the yearnings for admiration and righteousness. If you think you can change your life in a clever way, the way an advertiser can get you to buy an air freshener, you're probably wrong. As the Victorians understood, if you want to change your life, don't just look for a clever cue. Commit to some larger global belief.

119,"People who enjoy a dream-filled sleep are better at recalling information and making links between facts when they wake, scientists found. But recharging with a shallow nap   offers no such mental improvement, the research suggests. The results of the study add to the evidence that Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is very important to the brain's ability to strengthen memories.  An average night's sleep includes four or five periods of REM sleep, but these tend to be longer towards the end of the night. This means that adults who get less than the recommended seven to eight hours a night -- and therefore inadequate REM sleep -- may be damaging their mind's ability to form strong memories. Although REM sleep is not classified as a type of deep sleep, it is only reached after the brain has passed through deep sleep stages.   In the most recent study, participants were shown groups of three words -- such as ""cookie"", ""heart"", and ""sixteen"" -- and asked to find another word that can be associated with all three words. In this example, the answer would have been ""sweet"". They were tested once in the morning and then given the same task again in the afternoon. In between, some were allowed a nap with REM sleep, some a nap without REM sleep, while the others had a quiet rest period. The quiet rest and non-REM sleep groups showed no improvement in their test results, but the REM sleep group improved on their morning performance by an average of almost 40 percent.    Dr Sara Mednick, a sleep researcher at the University of California who led the study, believes the formation of connections between previously unassociated information in the brain -- which leads to creative problem-solving -- is encouraged by mental changes which occur during REM sleep. People woken while their closed eyes made rapid movements recalled much more color1ful and detailed dreams than people woken during other stages of sleep.

120,"It was a sunny holiday Monday. Olivier Ferrante was cooking sausages on the barbecue and entertaining friends in his garden north of Paris when the phone  rang. The call came from the BEA, France's air accidents investigation bureau , where the 38-year-old former football player and driver was an investigator. The news was grim. ""An Airbus is missing over the Atlantic: we need you."" As a safety investigator,Ferrante and his teams had participated, directly and indirectly,in the recovery of crashed planes from the Red Sea, the Black Sea,and every ocean. But this investigation would be his toughest ever: the plane had disappeared without a witness, or a trace on radar . At least eight ships and a dozen military aircraft gathered on the plane's last  known position, about halfway between Brazil and Western Africa. After six days the aircraft's tail fin  and 50 bodies were spotted on the surface and the first burning questions were answered. The plane wreckage  and passenger injuries indicated the doomed Airbus was unbroken when it hit the water. It was not exploded apart by a bomb or lightning,  now broken up by violent weather. Strangely, no mayday  message had been sent by its pilots. Ferrante worked energetically with his team:collecting offers of help from around the world, consulting navy ministries and research organizations in France and elsewhere, and contracting suitable ships and high-tech equipment. He would not return home for another 29 days. His team used the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle(AUV) operated around the clock, searching about 400 square kilometers a day. But the race against time was lost and no signals were heard and no more wreckage was found. Day after day, the screen remained bare except for objects that turned out to be stones or garbage from ships.  Stressed by media attention and painful meetings with victims'  s,Ferrante went jogging one day to clear his head. Then he had an idea. He decided to look at what had happened to nine other planes that crashed after something abruptly went wrong while flying at high altitude. He found that none had traveled more than 30 km before hitting the sea; most covered less than half that distance. AUV operations continued but now they focused on a 30 km circle around the plane's last known position. On the ninth day of the new-strategy searching, after searching for 22 months, their hard work paid off finally. The first thing they saw was a woman's handbag. Next,they saw bits of twisted aircraft parts and a panel  with ""AF"" painted on it. Without a doubt,this was the missing Aribus,lying 11 km northeast of  its last known position, but nobody felt much like cheering the discovery. ""The screen also exposed well-preserved human bodies,and for some of us they were hard to look at,"" says Ferrante. What made it take so long a time to find the missing Airbus?",The investigators were not working hard as it was holiday  time.,No mayday message was sent by its pilots before crashing.,Not enough investigating force was put into the searching work.,The strategy used in the first stage of the search was not effective.,D
121,"Stepfamilies are commonplace in the United States and their number continues to grow.While stepfamilies differ widely in their make-up, they all consist of a parenting couple and children, one or more of whom is of a previous union.Such combinations of his kids, her kids, and then, possibly, kids of the new union make for complicated and often trying difficulties, more challenging than those of traditional families. Since stepfamilies involve more people and, consequently, more potential problems from the start than do childless new marriage, it is wise for the couple to do some careful planning prior to (=before) marriage.Not only do the prospective  marital partners need agreement about their own carriers, life goals, finance and special interests, they must also prepare for new relationship with their children and attempt to accommodate their individual needs and feelings.Furthermore, there are often the rights of other relatives to consider. As for any family, the basic ingredient  of a successful stepfamily are affection, kindness and mutual  respect.However, love alone is not enough.Certainly love is the cornerstone upon which the foundation of any family is built, but there are also many other important ingredients involved in building a successful stepfamily. Surveys reveal that successful families regard the ability to communicate openly as the most important factor in their success.Communication is what keeps families on track and functioning as a unit.Although healthy communication is easier for some people than for others, this skill can be learned and improved.Healthy communication involves speaking clearly and listening carefully. By their very nature, stepfamilies often are complicated by past events that give rise to ambivalent  loyalties, lingering  hurts, fears,feelings of guilt and unrealistic dreams.The difficulties that arise within the stepfamilies are human and understandable.However, there are ways to confront  and resolve them.For example, support groups and professional counselors  are available in most communities to provide help and guidance when communications stopped and problems seem overwhelming . Planning and building a stepfamily is not a responsibility to take lightly.It can be a very trying and, at times, seemingly impossible effort.Many potential troubles can arise and threaten to destroy the stepfamily.Nevertheless, meeting and mastering these special challenges can bring unexpected satisfactions and rewarding depths of family closeness and affection. According to the author, planning and building a stepfamily is     .",impossible,satisfying and rewarding,discouraging and frustrating,a difficult and trying experience,D
122,"What would you think if you went back to school on Monday and there were no desks or chairs in your classroom?  That's what some fourth-and-fifth-graders at a school in Minnesota discovered earlier this year when they took part in a research project to see if changing their classrooms would make them more active.  Researchers from the Mayo Clinic were concerned about reports that as many as half of American kids could be seriously overweight - or obese - by the year 2014. So they set up a different kind of classroom, which you might see in the future.  Instead of desks, the Elton Hills Elementary students had adjustable work stations where they could stand, kneel on mats or sit on big exercise balls. Students were given laptops and iPods that allowed them to move and learn at the same time.  Sensors   were attached to the kids' legs to calculate how many calories students burned in their new set-up.  Their typical school day was probably not anything like yours. One group of students downloaded an audio file   of their teacher reading a book; they listened to it while walking for exercise. Another group took a spelling test by listening to their iPods.  Some students liked the freedom, but others missed the traditional classroom.  ""I don't like standing up,"" Mariah Matrious said. ""My legs get tired, and I like sitting down. ""  So, did the experiment work? Researchers still are studying the data, but early results indicate that the kids did move around more in the new classroom. ""It showed us that, given the opportunity to move, kids will move,"" said researcher Lorraine Lanningham-Foster.  That's important because studies have shown that even simple movement - climbing stairs instead of taking an elevator , for example, or washing dishes by hand instead of loading the dishwasher - can be as important as formal exercise when it comes to controlling one's weight.

Some studies suggest it can help protect against cancer. Thanks to the health food craze, green tea sales are currently rising sharply. The Tea Association of the USA reports that green tea sales jumped more than 60 percent in the last decade. And in Canada, government data shows that profits for green tea imports more than quadrupled  . Nowadays, green tea seems to be everywhere. In shops, you can buy green tea leaves prepared in a number of ways: fried, powdered or steamed. Despite green tea's healthy reputation, the drink was once considered dangerous. Where did this silly opinion come from? Blame the Victorians, of course, who lived in a period of English history in the 19th century. That's when some of the silliest theories about green tea arose. One 1882 book described strange experiments to show the harm of green tea. Apply some green tea below a frog's stomach, and you could cause paralysis   in its legs, the book claimed. And injecting green tea into a dog would cause it to lose control of its legs and tail. The book went so far as to declare that green tea could kill someone. At that time, a green tea panic was sweeping England. Even Charlotte Bronte, a famous English writer, refused to touch the drink, fearing its terrible effects it would have on her nerves. Some of the fear was well reasonable, though. English consumers preferred brighter leaves, over dull olive- color1ed ones. As a result, tea sellers would dye   their products, using anything including poisons like ""Prussian blue"". Even today, mixing green tea with chemicals remains a problem.

126,"Three years ago I listened to a lecture on cognition that changed the way I think about intelligence. There are two types of cognition, and the first is normal cognition the ability to regain knowledge from memory. The second type of cognition is metacognition  the ability to know whether or not you know. Does this affect intelligence? In traditional education, intelligence is measured by cognitive ability. Some people can easily produce everything they know on a test. But others are awarded with poor grades and considered inferior (not as good as). But does this inability make them any less intelligent? If the question came up on a task, they could refer to a book or a quick Google search. In reality they're just as effective as the people that ace a test. They just can't prove it as easily. Metacognition is more important to success than cognition. A person with poor cognitive ability, but great metacognitive ability might do poorly in school, but when faced with a challenge, they understand their abilities and _ . For example, when faced with a question, a person with strong metacognitive ability will deal with it like this. If he knows the answer, but can't come up with it, he can always do a bit of research. If he knows for sure that he doesn't know, then he can start educating himself. Because he's aware of his ignorance, he doesn't act with foolish confidence. These people might not seem intelligent at first glance, but because they know what they know, they make better decisions and learn the most important things. However, people with great cognitive ability but poor metacognitive ability may be considered excellent at a young age for acing every test and getting great SAT scores. Unfortunately, they've been ruined by poor metacognition they think they know everything but they really don't. They are arrogant (overconfident), fail to learn from mistakes, and don't understand the slight differences of personal relationships, showing disregard for persons with lower cognitive ability. They may make the worst decisions. The most important mental power is the ability to know what you don't know .The recognition of a fault is the first step to improvement. Don't try to hide a lack of knowledge. For intelligent people this is the toughest lesson to learn.

128,"These days, young children can enjoy directly what it is like to be a marine biologist   at a marine association. What they discover can lead them to appreciate and protect the ocean and also the animals living in it. At the present time, learning isn't only limited to the classroom. It's quite common for kids to learn from outdoor experiences. Teachers commonly take their pupils on field trips to museums as well as other interesting areas. If you wish to help pupils to take care of the ocean, one of the best areas to take them to is a marine association, the place where the ocean biome   is shown. Taking your pupils to a marine association is a prefect way to help them learn. Education professionals agree that there are topics that children can learn more successfully whenever they experience them directly. Several organizations that focused on protecting the ocean now operate on the coast of different areas in America and all around the world. It's quite common for marine associations nowadays to open their doors several times a week to kids, parents, and ocean lovers to learn more about the ocean biome. A marine association has different programs for children of different ages. You'll find programs that are developed specially for pupils. Pupils are involved in interactive   learning. This learning experience allows young children to recognize the value of the role each species performs in their environment. They not only get to research creatures from the ocean, but they also get to see, touch, and smell most of these animals and plants. This type of _ offers students an idea about the life of a marine scientist. It could help them choose a career afterwards. These programs are generally held on Saturdays and Sundays in order that kids and parents can have more hours in which to have fun. Teachers who want to arrange these activities for their students can call a local marine association near them. According to the text, pupils can have a better understanding of the ocean biome by   _  .",learning about it from books,going to a marine association,attending marine biologists' meetings,taking part-time jobs at marine associations,B

I chose this job so I could travel the world, but the job has taught me many unforgettable lessons. The work is sometimes difficult. I have seen _ , wars, earthquakes, poverty and death. But I have also seen courage, hope and happiness. In India, I visited a city where there were many homeless children. Some were as young as four years old. They lived in the streets and survived by begging or stealing. But then a wonderful lady called Rosa opened a home for them. Within one year, she was looking after two hundred children. She clothed them, fed them, and taught them. She gave them hope. Another time, I was in Turkey after a terrible earthquake, in one place. I found an old lady whose house was in ruins, her son was missing and rescue workers said there was no chance that he was still alive. But the old lady did not give up hope. For four days, she moved heavy stones one at a time by herself. She did not stop until she found her son. He was alive. Here in China, I met a young boy with a serious condition. He had undergone twenty operations and spent nearly his whole life in hospital. I thought he would be sad, but when I met him, his smile was so warm and welcoming. In life, we need role models that we can admire and learn from. When my life is difficult, I try to remember the courage and goodness of these three people.

132,"Technology is making life easier for some dairy farmers.They use robotic systems to milk their cows.Cows are trained to follow a series of paths that lead to milking stations.Only one cow at a time can enter a station. Once inside,the cow is rewarded with food.As the cow eats,a  robotic arm cleans and connects the animal to the milking machine.A few minutes later,milking is complete.The gate is opened,the cow is released and the next cow enters. The robotic systems are designed to operate 24 hours a day.The cows get to decide when they want to be milked.Cows are milked an average of about three times a day.Some are milked four to six times a day. The cows wear collars around their necks that identify them to the system.A computer keeps records on their eating and milking.A cow is released from the station if the computer decides it should not be milked. The automated system also measures the temperature and color of freshly produced milk.Milk is thrown away if it does not pass the tests. Professor Plaut believes the systems will appeal  especially to the next generation of farmers.She means young people who are more interested in technology and less interested in working all the time on the farm.Still,she says the price of robotic milking systems will continue to limit their use. Doug and Tina Suhr have more than 100 cows on their family farm.Last year it became the fourth farm in southeast Minnesota to get a robotic milking system.A recent story in a local agricultural newspaper said the first robot cost 175 000 dollars.The second cost 150 000. Doug told AgriNews that wages that would have been paid for one employee in five years will pay for one robot.He says the increase in milk production reaches a high of more than six kilograms per cow per day.

140,"When the Farnsworth family moved to their new farm in 1919, eleven-year-old Philo was surprised to find it wired for electricity. This unusual circumstance contributed to his fate -- to become an important inventor of the twentieth century. By thirteen, Farnsworth had become a self-taught electrical engineer. He was able to fix the farm's generator when none of the adults could. In 1922, he read an article about a new idea of John Baird, a Scottish scientist, who had been working with the cathode ray tube   for the transmission of electronic pictures and wanted to attempt it himself. Farnsworth studied everything he could find on the subject. Although many older engineers with money backers were already developing television, Farnsworth made a bold decision -- he was going to perfect a working model of it before anybody else. In college, Farnsworth continued his research with cathode ray and vacuum tubes, but the death of his father, the only money maker in the family, forced him to give up this research and find a job. His first job was for George Everson, with whom Farnsworth discussed his dream of television. While acknowledging the achievements of those who came before, Farnsworth thought that he could get closer. Everson agreed to risk $6,000 for the research. Backers came in 1927 to see the first American television, one year after Baird's. They were astonished to see the image of a single white line resolve itself on the screen before them, and agreed that this new invention was worth putting money into. In 1930, Farnsworth won a patent   for his all-electronic TV. By the time he died, he had earned over 300 American and foreign patents for electronic and mechanical devices.

142,"Many people rely on a cup of coffee or two to wake them up in the morning or pick them up during the working day, but now a chemist has come up with a speedy alternative to crafting a cup of coffee. U.S. biochemist Ben Yu has created 'Sprayable Energy,' which claims to be the world's first caffeine - based topical energy spray. He said tired workers can spray a 'shot' of caffeine onto their skin without experiencing a strong buzz, loading up on unnecessary calories or being stuck with a nasty aftertaste like they might get from drinking energy drinks or coffee. The patent-pending caffeine spray is an odourless liquid that is absorbed through the skin and distributed through the body over a number of hours to deliver a caffeine hit that apparently lasts longer than guzzling a cup of coffee. Each small aluminum bottle of Sprayable Energy contains around 160 sprays - the equivalent amount of caffeine to 40 cups of coffee and the creators say it is a much cheaper way of getting a caffeine fix than popping to a cafe. The only active ingredient in the spray is caffeine, which can naturally enter the human body through the skin by passing through cell membranes as it is very similar to nicotine in structure. Each spritz of Sprayable Energy contains around a quarter of the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee, but apparently has the same effect as a full cup. The website said: 'The reason for this is our product not being ingested, isn't almost entirely metabolised  by the liver before entering your system and becoming available to your body.''Thus, a smaller amount of caffeine can have just the same effect as a very large amount of caffeine ingested through an energy drink or cup of coffee. Sprayable Energy`s website recommends that users apply the spray in places where they normally spritz perfume, such as the neck or wrists, but warns users not to exceed 20 sprays a day. It claims that after spraying the product on the skin, users will feel 'awake and focused without being over-stimulated', which is common with coffee and energy drinks. What can we learn about Sprayable Energy from the passage ?  _  .",A bottle of Sprayable Energyis cheaper than 40 cups of coffee. .,Sprayable Energy lets users not worry about taking in unnecessary calories..,Sprayable Energy can be used at least 20 sprays a day,The caffeine spray is a colorless liquid that is absorbed through the skin..,B

Anyway,you are too young to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life.If you spend the next few years at university,you will get to know the world--and yourself--before the time comes to choose your career. Answer B.Stop wasting your time on academia .Stop subjecting yourself to the boredom of textbooks and classrooms.Stop cramming for exams before you acquire a strong love for reading. The lack of a college degree will only be a slight influence on your career.In Britain,you can still get to the top without a degree.What industry and the government need at the top is not experts but leaders.The character traits which make people scholars in their youth are not the traits which make them leaders in later life.You put up with education for 12 boring years. Answer C.Don't judge the value of higher education in terms of careemanship.Judge it for what it is--a priceless opportunity to furnish your mind and enrich the quality of your life.My father was a failure in business,but he read Horace in the washroom until he died,poor but happy.

Therefore, it's very important we have to make sure the soybean, if genetically modified, is free from any poisonous matter harmful to human beings. For this we need very good testing. We do have some testing on some animals, but no completely satisfactory testing has ever been made so far. They're entirely new, and their problems are entirely unknown. It takes time to develop persuasive tests to know whether they're harmful to us or not. We may not be able to tell what may happen if we take GM foods. Some of them may be resistant to antibiotics  . Then many of the medicines we have today will have no effect on people eating GM foods. A more likely case is the GM foods may contain genes some people are allergic to. GM products have already come into our lives but most people even know nothing about it. At least we have to be clear about what we are eating. The China Consumers Association is calling for labeling   on GM foods so that consumers will know before they buy them. Which of the following is TRUE about GM foods?",The testing shows GM soybean foods are free from poisonous matter.,Sometimes consumers can hardly tell GM soybeans from natural ones.,GM foods prove to be safe to humans after some testing on animals.,GM foods problems have been known after testing on animals.,B
150,"Thanks to science, industry and moral philosophy, mankind's steps were at last guided up the right path in the past century. The 19th century of steam was about to give way to the 20th century of oil and electricity. Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, only 41 years old in 1900, provided a scientific basis for the idea that progress was not to be stopped, determined by natural law. And almost everybody thought that the development would continue to be as slow as that in the 19th century. Inventions like the railroad or the telegraph or the typewriter enabled people to live their everyday lives a little more conveniently. No one could have guessed that new ideas would storm the world with a force and frequency at an amazing pace. This high-speed attack of new ideas and technologies seemed to make people believe in the old dreams of a perfect life on earth, of a safe world in which natural disasters would be controlled. But the fast progress was accompanied by something against mankind's will. Murders in Sarajevo  in 1914 led to the Great War, which did more than destroy a generation of Europeans. The Great War was most commonly called so until the beginning of World War II when it was renamed World War I. Hitler rose to power in the 1930's. It was this very man who ordered the attack of prefix = st1 /Poland, only to meet with his failure whenGreat BritainandFrancemade war onGermany. On December 7, 1941, the Japanese bombed the American naval base at Pearl harbor. Americans decided to enter the war, and World War II was now truly a world war. But civilization was not crushed  by the two great wars, and from the ruins people built a way of life again. The citizens of the 20th century felt free to reinvent themselves. In that task they were aided by two far-reaching developments-Psychoanalysis  and the Bomb. It can be inferred from the passage that at the beginning of the 20th century   _  .",great changes occurred between the 19th century and the 20th century,"the world knew nothing about science, industry and moral philosophy",mankind came to realize there was not a change in the 19th century,"Darwin, the builder of the theory of evolution, was in his forties",A

154,"Parents are fuelling bad behavior among their children by attempting to ""buy"" their love with expensive gifts nowadays. Over recent decades we seem to have created a ""must have"" culture among our young people. Many mothers and fathers believe they are ""failing as parents"" if they are unable to ensure that their children have the latest toy, electronic devices (the lap-top, cellphones, Game Boy, etc.) along with their friends. In many cases, families also feel pressured to enroll   children in ""'every interest club or after-school activity that is available"" to fill up their time like most of the other children. But experts warned that the move might affect ""precious family time"" negatively. Graham Gorton, chairman of the Independent Schools Association, said that parents spent too much time filling their children's lives, which had a series of negative effects on ""the very precious family time that exists"". ""It seems that those times when a whole weekend without planned work was seen as a luxury   and a perfect opportunity to spend time together and share those valuable moments of childhood are long gone,"" Mr. Gorton said. ""As a child I only once said that phrase that parents feared 'I'm bored'. Immediately my mother took action and produced a list of jobs and then insisted that I complete every one of them. Though l didn't think cleaning all the floors could really get rid of my boredom, I enjoyed the feeling of staying at home with my mother and brothers."" Earlier this year, some researchers suggested that relatively wealthy parents were sometimes guilty of failing to teach basic social skills to children.

That then sets them apart from their family, and then the parents are surprised when their child isn' t coming to school.""

156,"Plants are very important living things. Life could not go if there were no plants. This is because plants can make food from air, water and sunlight. Animals and man cannot make food from air, water and sunlight. Animals get their food by eating plants and other animals. So animals and man need plants in order to live. This is why we find that there are so many plants around us. If you look carefully at the plants around you, you will find that there are two kinds of plants: flowering plants and  _ plants. Flowering plants can make seeds. The seeds are protected by the fruits. Some fruits have one seed, some have two, three or four, and some have many seeds. But a few fruits have no seeds at all. An example of a fruit without seeds is the banana fruit. Most non-flowering plants don't grow from seeds. They grow from spores. Spores are so small and light that they can float in the air.

Wang Ye, 14, said she would like the real one although the pirated one is cheaper."" A real one is worth keeping for years."" said the girl from No.1 middle school in Wu Han, Anhui. ""Real CDs always sound better to me."" What can we do? People want to do more to help those like Wang to get real CDs. This week the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry asked many countries to act against piracy . In many places in China, the government is checking audio and video products. Pirated ones are broken into pieces. Piracy is in your daily life. Don't believe it? A study by 21st Century Teens found that more than 75 percent of juniors had listened to pirated music. They say this is because pirated products are usually much cheaper than the real ones. Why are real CDs so expensive? When a music company makes music, it needs to pay the song writers and singers. It costs a lot of money! This makes the price of the CDs go up. Piracy like stealing. People who make pirated copies of CDs take away the writers' and singers' work without paying them. They even don't ask them if they can. So next time you'd better keep your eyes brightened when you see cheap CDs. Remember you're helping someone to do something wrong if you buy them.

No, the world's first hamburger comes from China. If you're scratching your head right now, you're not alone. But Chinese hamburgers are very real and they definitely predate the hamburgers we call our own in the U.S. Known as rou jia mo, which translates to ""meat burger"" or ""meat sandwich"", they consist of chopped meat inside a pita-like _ , and they've been around since the Qin Dynasty, from about 221 BC to 207 BC. Despite the differences between this Chinese street food and our American-style burgers, the rou jia mo has been called the world's first hamburger. The rou jia mo originated in the Shanxi Province of China, and is now eaten all over the country. It's typically prepared and eaten on the street. The dough for the bun, or mo, consists of a simple mixture of wheat flour, water and maybe yeast. Of course recipes may vary, but this basic equation makes for a chewy and subtle pillow for the delicious filling. While the mo is traditionally baked in a clay oven, today it's often fried in a pan. They may look a little like Chinese steamed buns or baozi, but the dough for those are, of course, steamed, not baked or fried.

162,"The term ""multitasking"" originally referred to a computer's ability to carry out several tasks at one time. For many people, multitasking has become a way of life and even a key to success. In fact, some excellent mental aerobic exercises involve engaging the brain in two or more challenging activities at a time. Although checking e-mail while talking on a phone and reading the newspaper may be second nature for some people, many times multitasking can make us less productive, rather than more. And studies show that too much multitasking can lead to increased stress, anxiety and memory loss. In order to multitask, the brain uses an area known as the prefrontal cortex  . Brain scans of volunteers performing multiple tasks together show that as they shift from task to task, this front part of the brain actually takes a moment of rest between tasks. You may have experienced a prefrontal cortex ""moment of rest"" yourself if you've ever dialed a phone number and suddenly forgotten who you dialed when the line is answered. What probably occurred is that between the dialing and the answering, your mind shifted to anther thought or task, and then took that ""moment"" to come back. Research has also shown that for many volunteers, job efficiency declines while multitasking, as compared to when they perform only one task at a time. Multitasking is easiest when at least one of the tasks is habitual, or requires little thought. Most people don't find it difficult to eat and read the newspaper at the same time. However, when two or more attention-requiring tasks are attempted at one time, people sometimes make mistakes. We often don't remember things as well when we're trying to manage several details at the same time. Without mental focus, we may not pay enough attention to new information coming in, so it never makes it into our memory stores. That is one of the main reasons we forget people's names--even sometimes right after they have introduced themselves. Multitasking can also affect our relationships. If someone checks their e-mail while on the phone with a friend, they may come off as absent-minded or disinterested. It can also cause that person to miss or overlook key information being passed on to them. Why are some mental aerobic exercises designed to engage people in multitasking?",To make them more productive.,To reduce their stress and anxiety.,To develop their communication skills.,To help them perform daily tasks more easily.,A

I would walk behind an ox, guiding him with a broomstick. For $ 1 a day, I worked eight hours straight, with no food breaks. It was very _ work, but it prepared me for life and taught me many lasting lessons. Because the plantation owners were always watching us, I had to be on time every day and work as hard as I could. I've never been late for any job since. I also learned about being respectful and faithful to the people you work for. More important, I earned my pay; it never entered my mind to say I was sick just because I didn't want to work. I was only six years old, but I was doing a man's job. Our family needed every dollar we could make because my father never earned more than $ 18 a week. Our home was a three-room wood shack with a dirty floor and no toilet.

It is a network of offices, some of which provide food and houses for the homeless population, and some of which fight for the passing of laws that would give every American the right to a place to call home. According to the Coalition's studies, of over two hundred million people living in the United States, up to three million are homeless--and the number is still growing. Since the late 1970s, fast-rising house prices, large cuts in government supported housing programs, and economic recession  have make it impossible for many Americans to meet housing costs. Sadly, this has resulted in a number of persons being forced to leave their homes and/or unable to find new affordable homes. According to another research, families with children appear to be the fastest-growing part of the homeless population, making up 39% of it. The old idea of a homeless person, that of the single man who gets drunk all the time, is no longer true. A much larger part of the population now finds itself homeless.

167,"In America, drivers' education is part of the regular high school curriculum. Every student in his or her second year of high school is required to take a class in driver's education. However, unlike other courses, it is not given during the regular school year. Instead it is a summer course. The course is divided up into two parts: class time for learning laws and regulations and driving time to practice driving. Class time is not unlike any other class. The students have a text from which they study the basic laws they must know to pass the written driving test that is given to anyone wanting to get a driver's license. Driving time is a chance for the students to get behind the wheel (steering wheel) and practice starting steering, backing up, parking, switching lanes, turning corners, and all the other maneuvers   required to drive a car. Each student is required to drive a total of six hours. The students are divided up into groups of four. The students and the instructor go out driving for two hour blocks of time. Thus, each student gets half an hour driving time per outing. The instructor and ""driver"" sit in the front seats and the other three students sit in the back. Drivers Ed cars are unlike other cars in which they have two sets of brakes, one on the driver's side and one on the other side where the instructor sits. Thus, if the student driver should run into difficulties the instructor can take over. The car also has another special feature. On the top of the car is a sign that reads: STUDENT DRIVER. That lets nearby drivers know that they should use extra caution because the student driver is a beginning driver, not very experienced and prone to driving slowly. After the student has passed the driver's education course and reached the appropriate age to drive (this age differs in every state but in most cases the person must be 16 years old), they can go to a designated state office to take their driver's test, which is made up of an eye examination, a written test, and a road test. The person must pass all three tests in order to be given a driver's license. If the person did well in his or her driver's education class, he or she will pass the test with flying colors and get a driver's license.

172,"Have you had this experience? You are watching a movie. A man is shooting on the screen. The picture is so real that you think he is shooting at you. Or a car is speeding on the screen and at one point you are afraid that it will hit you. Three-dimensional(3D)movies use special technology to make pictures seem more real and exciting than two-dimensional ones. The popular movie Avatar uses 3D technology. So far we can only see 3D movies in the cinema with a special screen and projector .But soon, we will be able to watch them in our living rooms. Last month, Woods Company told reporters that it plans to bring 3D televisions to homes in the near future. The company is also hoping to make other products with 3D, like laptops and PS3 ""The 3D train is on the track, and we are ready to drive it home,"" said the President. 3D movies and TV programs are fun to watch, but do you know how they are made? It is much easier to understand if we do an experiment. Hold one of your fingers up at arms length and close one eye. Then try closing the other eye. As you switch between open eyes, you should see your finger ""jumping"" left and right against the background. This happens because our two eyes are about 4cm away from each other. The separation causes each eye to see the world from a different angle. The brain puts these two views together. What you see becomes three-dimensional. 3D movies are made using two video cameras at the same time, which creates two different images.

173,"Maurice Sendak's children's book,Where the Wild Things Are,published in 1963,has become very successful throughout the years and was made into a movie earlier this year. The book's main character is a boy named Max who gets into trouble with his mother and is sent to bed without any supper.Before long,Max's room magically becomes a forest,and he sails away to a land where monsters live.Max isn't scared,though,and becomes king of the wild things,but after a while,he begins feeling homesick.Max sails back home and his supper is still hot when he arrives in his bedroom. Many teachers and professors like this story and use it to help children develop creativity and imagination.  Melina Davis,an education professor,said she likes how the book contains a couple of pages that have only pictures on them. ""This allows children to shape the story themselves,"" she said. The book contains a few of larger words that some parents worry may confuse children,but experts say those words help improve children's reading skills and challenge them. Davis said the book is well written which helps kids get involved in the story. ""The book talks about what all children go through,like 'I was naughty but my mommy still loves me'"" Davis said. The book also encourages children to face their fears.""I think it's really good to show that Max is friends with the monsters,"" Davis said.""Kids can find out monsters aren't always the thing under the bed that's going to scare them.I think this is good because it shows that the children can go to scary places but still have a positive experience."" Since the book has been successful throughout the years,a movie was recently made and many people are excited to see it.Davis said she thinks the movie will be wonderful but it might be a little scary for younger children.""You don't want bad dreams over a book that's extremely wonderful'"" Davis said. What is the intention of using the larger words in the book?",To add to the difficulty while children are reading.,To help challenge the children's reading skills.,To cause the children some confusion.,To help children get involved in the story.,B
174,"David Beckham had a dream: to be the first English player to appear in four World Cups.But now it appears that dream is over after a serious injury to his Achilles tendon   which means he could be out of action for around six months.With this year's World Cup in South Africa only three months away, sadly Beckham looks set to miss out.The injury happened while Beckham was playing for AC Milan against AC Chievo in the Italian league.After attempting to kick the ball he fell to the ground and hobbled off the pitch before being stretchered  away. It is not yet known whether he has completely severed  his Achilles tendon or only torn it.The player has now flown to Finland for assessment and treatment by a knee specialist. England manager Fabio Capello fears the worst for Beckham's World Cup chances. ""We have to wait for the results of the scan but it looks like he is out of the World Cup,"" he said in a statement.""I spoke with him after the game on Sunday night to offer my support. ""David is a great professional and has worked very hard to be ready for the World Cup, so missing it will be a big blow."" Beckham's former manager at American club LA Galaxy, Alexei Lalas, echoed  Capello's words of support: ""It is a horrible situation for Beckham.I know how much it meant to him to be in the World Cup and how important he was to the England team. David Beckham is now 34 and some are asking whether this serious injury could mean his whole career is over. Whatever happens, as one of football's best-known and popular players, Beckham will have no shortage of encouragement from fans around the world. Some will remember Beckham's miraculous recovery from an Achilles injury in 2006, when he was back on the pitch after only eight weeks. If he could repeat the same feat in time for the World Cup it really would be the stuff of fairytales.

175,"Self-employed private physicians who charge a fee for each patient visit are the foundation of medical practice in the United States. Most physicians have a contract relationship with one or more hospitals in the community. They send their patients to this hospital, which usually charges patients according to the number of days they stay and the facilities(operating room, tests, medicines that they use). Some hospitals belong to a city, a state or, in the case of veteran's hospitals, a federal government agency. Others are operated by religious orders  or other non-profit groups. Some medical doctors are on salary. Salaried physicians may work as hospital staff members, or residents, who are often still in training. They may teach in medical schools, be hired by corporations to care for their workers or work for the federal government's Public Health Service. Physicians are among the best paid professionals in the United States. In the 1980s, it was not uncommon for medical doctors to earn incomes of more than $ 100 000 a year. Specialists, particularly surgeons, might earn several times that amount. Physicians list many reasons why they deserve to be so well rewarded for their work. One reason is the long and expensive preparation required to become a physician in the United States. Most would be physicians first attend college for four years, which can cost nearly $ 20 000 a year at one of the best private institutions. Prospective physicians then attend medical school for four years. Tuition alone can exceed $ 10 000 a year. By the time they have obtained their medical degrees, many young physicians are deeply in debt. They still face three to five years of residency  in a hospital, the first year as an apprentice physician. The hours are long and the pay is relatively low. Setting up a medical practice is expensive, too. Sometimes several physicians will decide to establish a group practice, so they can share the expense of maintaining an office and buying equipment. These physicians also take care of each other's patients in emergencies. Physicians work long hours and must accept a great deal of responsibility. Many medical procedures, even quite routine ones, involve risk. It is understandable that physicians want to be well rewarded for making decisions which can mean the difference between life and death. Sometimes several physicians set up a group medical practice mainly because   _  .",there are so many patients that it is difficult for one physician to take care all of them,they can take turns to work long hours,facilities may be too much of a burden for one physician to shoulder,no one wants to assume too much responsibility,C

Well read on, as this month we're going to hear from overseas teens about what they do to help the environment. I can't remember when I started collecting litter . But it was when I got tired of seeing litter near my home and realized that no one else was going to pick it up. I live close to a forest in Ohio, America. I can walk there in three minutes! I used to love going there to play with my dog. But one day there was so much litter there that I became very unhappy. I decided I had to clean up the forest. I wanted to feel happy going there again. I made my first trip to clean the forest that afternoon. I took a big black rubbish bag with me. Ten minutes after starting to pick up litter, my bag was full! It had cans, bottles, broken glass and newspapers in it. Since that first trip three years ago. I've gone to the forest four times a year to pick up litter. I'm often there for three hours. It makes me feel great to do something for the environment. After each trip, I look at all the litter I've found. If any of it is recyclable , I keep it.I can't understand why people drop litter. But I will keep picking it up until they stop dropping it.

179,"When I was in elementary school, my teachers would always complain about my behavior in class. There was no doubt that I had a great deal of energy, and therefore I was always talking with my classmates and not paying attention to the lessons, which my teacher _ to see. If you don't believe me, the comments on my report cards every year can tell the story. In my third year in elementary school, my teacher wrote, "" Neil should tend to have a more serious attitude towards his schoolwork."" And in my fifth year in elementary school, my teacher wrote, "" Neil is not a bit strict with his work, his compositions as well as his notebook and so on. He has to be encouraged and urged by his parents or teachers."" After only a few months, my sixth-grade teacher wrote, "" Less social involvement and more academic diligence  is in order."" Later that same school year, my sixth-grade teacher noticed that all my book reports were about the universe. Knowing that I had a lot of extra energy, she recommended that I should take advanced after-school classes about the universe at the Hayden Planetarium. From then on, my love of the universe became stronger and stronger. Instead of killing my time in class, I focused my extra energy on the subject that would be bound to become my career. Between the ages of eleven and seventeen, I took about eight courses on the universe. For each one, I received an attractive certificate of completion, signed by both the teacher and the head of the Hayden Planetarium. We still offer these classes today. And we still give out certificates of completion, which are signed by the teacher and, of course, the head --- me. I am the head of the Hayden Planetarium.

181,"Treatment for HIV has become more widespread, especially in poorer countries. It's also become cheaper, as medicine companies have lowered their prices for life-saving anti-retroviral drugs . But these drugs are still expensive and many countries are looking to create the biggest impact with limited resources. That's where World Health Organization guidelines come in, says Rochelle Walensky, a disease researcher from Harvard. Walensky and her colleagues used computer programs to model the most cost-effective disease interventions , as well as collected data from clinics in Africa and India about what works best. They found that among the choices of what to do first, earlier anti-retroviral therapy  improved five-year survival dramatically and resulted in the longer life expectancy. But cost-effective doesn't always mean affordable, especially for governments in poor countries. Countries still have to make difficult choices about how much treatment they can afford. People in Nairobi, Kenya on Thursday, Dec. 9, 2010, protest a potential free trade area agreement between the EU and India that could see cheap anti-AIDS drugs phased out . However, Walensky notes that first-line anti-retrovirals--those medicine given to newly diagnosed patients that can keep away from symptoms for years - are much cheaper than they were a decade ago. ""Second-line therapy have come down quite a bit but not to the level of first-line and countries are having a hard time affording them and increasingly over time, people are going to fail first-line therapy and they're going second-line therapy and then, eventually, they're going to need third-line therapy, some of them.""

""I just want the students to know that I'm also wearing green. And we are all great people and are as good as those wearing red scarves."" The First Experimental Primary School in Xi'an made children with poor schoolwork and behavior wear green scarves. Parents whose children wore green scarves were angry. ""The children still need their self-esteem   even though they are very young, and they know the green scarf means something is not quite right,"" said one mother. Now, the school has stopped the practice. Educational expert Li Zhenxi said that primary and junior high school students have strong self-esteem. They are eager to be respected and understood. Punishment will hurt them. ""It's better to encourage them rather than separating some 'bad' students,"" he said. A survey made by the Ministry of Education   shows that 75 percent of students feel nervous and scared when the teacher is about to announce their grades. Some schools have done better in protecting students' privacy and encouraging them. In American schools, teachers post test results on the wall. Instead of using student names, they use secret numbers. This way, students know their secret numbers and can check their own grades only. Some teachers might call the students up to the desk and tell them their scores one at a time. But test scores are not the only measures of a student's ability.

186,"New York, the city that never sleeps, fell silent last week--schools were closed; bus and subway services were stopped; flights were canceled, and even the stock market closed for the first time since 1985. All the disorder was caused by one thing, the arrival of hurricane Sandy. This big storm landed on Oct 29 on the US east coast and brought damaging winds, flooding, blackouts   and heavy snow. Sandy is one of the largest storms that have ever hit the US, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. By the afternoon of Nov1 (Beijing time), about 140 deaths were caused by the storm as it traveled across the Caribbean islands and into the US. Unlike most hurricanes that happen during summer, Sandy was strengthened not only by warm ocean water, but also by the cold air coming from the northwest. Sandy's power grew because of the difference in masses between the warm and wet air and cool and dry air. It became a kind of ""super-storm"", the Guardian reported. The flooding was particularly severe. Scientists said it was because Sandy's arrival happened together with a full moon, which normally means higher-than-usual tides  . ""The most worrying aspect of Sandy is the high tides,"" Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee told Reuters before the storm arrived. ""With the full moon on Monday, with Sandy coming up the bay, we're very concerned about flooding in our low-lying coastal areas."" Apart from the power of Sandy itself, another reason why her arrival has caused so much damage is that its target area is crowded with big cities such as New York and Philadelphia. These urban areas are home to tens of millions of people. The flood, the snow and the blackout have brought the country's financial and political centers to a stop. ""The size of this alone, affecting a heavily populated area, is history making."" Said Jeff Masters, a hurricane specialist. According to the text, hurricane Sandy   _  .",only got its power from the warm ocean water,grew stronger than other hurricanes because of the full moon,led to flooding in many cities around the US,"brought with it strong winds, high tides, blackouts and heavy snowfall",D

Just before she died, she asked Elizabeth and me to go to her room. She held our hands and said, ""Victor and Elizabeth, my children, I'm very happy because you love each other, and because one day you'll get married. Everyone in the family loves you, Elizabeth. Will you take my place in the family, my dear? I can die happy if you look after them when I have gone."" My mother died and we were very sad, because we loved her dearly. Elizabeth was brave and helped us; her sweet smile gave us some happiness in the unhappy days after my mother's death. The time came for me to go to university. I didn't want to leave my sad family, but we all knew that I should go. It was hard to leave, too, because the parents of my good friend Henry would not let him go to university with me. So I had gone alone. On my first day at university I met my teacher, Professor Waldman, who was one of the greatest scientists in the world. He gave a wonderful talk to all the students who were starting at the university. He ended his talk by saying, ""Some of you will become the greatest scientists of tomorrow. You must study hard and discover everything that you can. This is why God made you intelligent--to help other people."" After the professor's talk, I thought very carefully. I remembered the storm when I was 15; I remembered how the lightning had destroyed the tree. From then on, I wanted to use electricity to help people, and I wanted to discover the secrets of life. I decided to work on these two things. I started to work the next day. I worked very hard and soon Professor Waldman and I realized that I could learn to be a very good scientist.

I was interested in my work and I did not take one day's holiday during the next two years, I did not go home, and my letters to my family were very short.

I had to watch bodies from the moment when they died and the warm life left them. In the hospital and in the university, I watched the dying and the dead.

191,"In the past, young people inprefix = st1 /Japanwere expected to take on responsibilities to support their parents and grandparents. Now they expect to be supported well into young adulthood. The ""New breed"", born since the 1960s, have never known anything but richness. Youth are seen as resistant to entering society as mature adults, to becoming social citizens. Once the great objective of reconstruction after the Second World War was accomplished, a new generation lost the motivating power that had untied the nation together.  Japan's birth rate has been falling rapidly, partly because of the recession , and the job and financial insecurity that it has caused. In 1999, the figure was 1. 38 children per woman, the lowest ever recorded. At the same time, youth crime, although still especially low by western standards, rose to its highest level since record-keeping began 32 years ago. Likewise, the percentage of students dropping out before graduating, at 2. 5% also very low by western standards, has been rising.  Entrepreneurial ( ) role models are few and far between. Bill Gates is often mentioned, but a foreign model can only have so much influence. The problem is that Japanese culture discourages people from revealing details of personal life, including such ordeal as starting a company. In the past, successful companies such as Honda or Hitachiprovided role models of a sort. But today they have been faded by the downturn, and few others have risen to take their place.  Young people also quite often feel isolated from their fathers, who worked too hard at their jobs to establish much of a relationship with their children. ""The one thing they're sure of is that they don't want to be like their fathers. And the girls don't want to be with boys who are like their fathers, so the boys are sure not to be,"" says Professor Morishma.

192,"Why would an animal kill itself? It seems a strange question, and yet it is one that has made some scientists curious for a long time. For there is a kind of animal called lemming , that periodically killed themselves together, and no one knows just why! The small creatures which live in the Scandinavian mountains, feed on a diet of roots and special insects and live in nests they dig underground. When their food supply is large, the lemmings live a normal and undisturbed life. However, when the lemmings' food supply becomes too low to support the population, a _ migration begins. The lemmings leave their nests in groups. Great numbers of them begin to travel across the Scandinavian plains, a journey that may last weeks. The lemmings eat everything in their path, continuing their long march until they reach the sea. The reason for what follows remains unbelievable to naturalists. Upon reaching the coast, the lemmings do not stop but swim by the thousands into the sea. Most stay afloat only a short time before they tire, sink and drown. A common theory for this mass self-killing is that the lemmings do not realize that the ocean is such a huge body of water in their cross-country journey, the animals must cross many smaller bodies of water, such as rivers and small lakes. They may think that the sea is just another such swimmable path to go through. But no final answer has been found to the strange happening. A reason for the lemmings' self-killing might be that they  _  .",go mad from a lack of food,hope to find fish for food,decide to reduce the population,think they can cross the sea,D
193,"It helps to choose the colors you plan to live with in your home with awareness of how different colors affect your emotional and physical states. Every color has a unique meaning, and this can significantly affect how you feel in a room. A room that is painted red will energize, inspire activity and movement, help passion, and be powerful and stimulating. A red room can also be exhausting and overpowering, and stressful for those who are anxious. Orange rooms encourage happy, joyful, social gatherings. While an orange dining room or family room can stimulate the appetite, it is a great choice for such gathering places. Orange enhances parties, communication, positive feelings, and general good cheer. Yellow rooms inspire intellectual clarity, organization, clear -headed thinking, and happy energy. Yellow is considered a color for the logical left side of the brain. Yellow is also very bright and somewhat energizing. Blue rooms are often chosen for bedrooms and meditation rooms because its cool energy is very calming, restful, peaceful, and spiritual. Blue helps inspire a quiet meditative quality, and color therapy with blue has been found to reduce blood pressure. Blue is also useful to make one to sleep.

196,"I shall never forget the night, a few years ago, when Marion J. Douglas was a student in one of my calsses. (I have not used his real name for personal reasons. As he requested.) But here is his real story as he told it before one of our adult - education classes. He told us how tragedy had struck at his home, not once, but twice. The first time he had lost his five-old daughter, a child he adored. He and his wife thought they couldn't bear that first loss; but, as he said:""Ten months later, God gave us another little girl and she died in five days."" This double was almost too much to bear. ""I couldn't take it,"" this father told us. ""I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I couldn't rest or relax. My nerves were entirely shaken and my confidence gone."" At last he went to doctors; one recommended sleeping pills and another recommended a trip. He tried both, but neither helped. He said:""My body felt as if it was surrounded in a vice , and the jaws of the vice were being drawn tighter and tighter."" The tension of grief ----if you have ever been paralyzed by sorrow, you know what he meant. But thank God, I had one child left ----a four --year-- old son. He gave me the solution to my problem. One afternoon as I sat around feeling sorry for myself, he asked; 'Daddy, will you build a boat for me?' I was in no mood to build a boat; in fact, I was in no mood to do anything. But my son is a persistent little fellow! I had to give in. Building that toy boat took me about three hours. By the time it was finished, I realized that those three hours spent building that boat were first hours of mental relaxation and peace that I had had in months! I realized that it is difficult to worry while you are busy doing something that requires planning and thinking. In my case, building the boat had knocked worry out of the ring. So I determined to keep busy. The following night, I went from room to room in the house, making a list of jobs that ought to be done. Scores of items needed to be repaired: bookcase, stair steps, storm windows, window-shades, locks, leaky taps. Amazing as it seems, in the course of two weeks I had made a list of 242 items that needed attention. ""During the last two years I have completed most of them. I am busy now that I have no time for worry."" No time for worry! That is exactly what Winston Churchill said when he was working eighteen hours a day at the height of the war.

197,"Death Valley, one of America's great national parks, is a place of strange and silent beauty. As beautiful as this place is, its name provides evidence of very real danger. Death Valley is a land of beautiful yet dangerous extremes. There are mountains that reach more than 3,000 meters into the sky. There is a place called Badwater that is the lowest area of land in the Western Hemisphere. If there were water there, it would be 86 meters below the level of the ocean. Death Valley can be dangerously cold during the winter months. Storms in the mountains can produce sudden flooding on the floor of the Valley. The air temperature during the summer has been as high as 57degC. The sun can heat the ground so that the temperature of the rocks and soil can be as high as 74degC. The extreme heat of Death Valley has killed people in the past. It will continue to kill those who do not honor this extreme climate. Death Valley does not forgive those who are not careful. Death Valley is a good example of the violence of nature. It contains evidence of several ancient volcanoes that caused huge explosions. Evidence of one of these explosions is called Ubehebe Crater. The explosion left a huge hole in the ground almost a kilometer and a half wide. In many areas of Death Valley it is easy to see where the ground has been pushed up violently by movement deep in the Earth. This movement has created unusual and beautiful rock formations. Some are red. Others are dark brown, gray, yellow or black. Other areas of rock look as if some huge creature violently broke and _ the Earth to create unusual, sometimes frightening shapes. In other parts of Death Valley there are lines in the rock that show clearly that this area was deep under an ocean for many thousands of years. Much of the Valley is flat and extremely dry. In fact, scientists believe it is the driest place in the United States. Death Valley, part of the Great Mojave Desert, is a huge place. It extends more than 225 kilometers across the southern part of California, and across the border with Nevada.

205,"Five or six years ago, I attended a lecture on the science of attention. A professor who conducts research over in the medical school was talking about attention blindness, the basic feature of the human brain that, when we concentrate on one task, causes us to miss just about everything else. Because we can't see what we can't see, our lecturer was determined to catch us in the act. He had us watch a video of six people tossing   basketballs back and forth, three in white shirts and three in black, and our task was to keep track only of the tosses among the people in white. The tape rolled, and everyone began counting. Everyone except me. I'm dyslexic  , and the moment I saw that tape with the confusing basketball tossers, I knew I wouldn't be able to keep track of their movements, so I let my mind wander. I became curious, though, when about 30 seconds into the tape, a gorilla   walked in among the players. She (we later learned a female student was in the gorilla suit) stared at the camera, beat her chest with her fist, and then went away while they continued passing the balls. When the tape stopped, the professor asked how many people had counted at least a dozen basketball tosses. Hands went up all over. He then asked who had counted 13, 14, and congratulated those who'd scored the perfect 15. Then he asked, ""And who saw the gorilla?"" I raised my hand and was surprised to discover I was the only person at my table and one of only three or four in the large room to do so. He'd set us up, trapping us in our own attention blindness. Yes, there had been a trick, but he wasn't the one who had played it on us. By concentrating so hard on counting, we had managed to miss the gorilla in the midst. Attention blindness is the fundamental organizing principle of the brain, and I believe that it presents us with a great opportunity. My take is different from that of many neuroscientists: Where they see the shortcomings of the individual, I sense an opportunity for cooperation. Fortunately, given the interactive   nature of most of our lives in the digital age, we have the tools to control our different forms of attention and take advantage of them. It's not easy to admit that everything we've learned about how to pay attention means that we've been missing everything else. It's not easy for us logical, intelligent, confident types to admit that the very key to our success -- our ability to discover a problem and solve it, an achievement obtained in all those years in school and beyond -- may be exactly what limits us. No one ever told us that our way of seeing left out everything else. What's the total number of basketball tosses by the players in white shirts in the video?",13.,14.,15.,30.,C

213,"An allergy is a strong reaction to a substance. Many things can cause allergies. The most common cause is pollen  , which is usually produced by trees in the spring, grasses in the summer and weeds in the fall, as part of their reproductive process. Other causes include organisms, chemicals, plants and dead skin particles from dogs and cats can also cause allergic reactions. So can insect stings and some food. The most common kind of allergic reactions is itchy   , watery eyes and a blocked or watery nose. Allergies can also cause red, itchy skin. Some reactions can be life-threatening, for example, when breathing passages become blocked. It is not always easy to avoid allergies. Drugs may offer an effective treatment. Another treatment used in some cases is called immunotherapy. A patient is injected with small amounts of the allergy-causing substance. The idea is that larger and larger amounts are given over time until the patient develops resistance in his body. In the United States, experts estimate that up to 8% of young children have food allergies. Every year these allergies cause about 30,000 cases with severe reactions that require immediate treatment. It can result in breathing trouble and in some cases death. It is said that about 100 to 200 people will die. It is said that most of the reactions are caused by peanuts and tree nuts like walnuts. People can also be allergic to medicines. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology says about 10% of bad reactions to commonly used medicines are allergic. In other words, a person's immune system overreacts and produces an allergic reaction. The most common reactions include skin rashes, itching, breathing problems and swelling in areas such as the face.

214,"A few degrees can make a big difference when it comes to food storage.Foods can go bad if they get too warm.But for many of the world's poor, finding a good way to keep food cool is difficult.Refrigerators are costly and they need electricity. Yet spoiled food not only creates health risks but also economic losses.Farmers lose money when they have to throw away products that they cannot sell quickly. But in nineteen ninety-five a teacher in northern Nigeria named Mohammed Bah Abba found a solution.He developed the ""Pot-in-Pot Preservation/Cooling System."" It uses two round containers made of clay.A smaller pot is placed inside a larger one.The space between the two pots is filled with wet sand.The inner pot can be filled with fruit, vegetables or drinks.A wet cloth covers the whole cooling system. Food stored in the smaller pot is kept from spoiling through a simple evaporation process.Water in the sand between the two pots evaporates through the surface of the larger pot, where drier outside air is moving.The evaporation process creates a drop in temperature of several degrees.This cools the inner pot and helps keep food safe from harmful bacteria.Some foods can be kept fresh this way for several weeks. People throughout Nigeria began using the invention.And it became popular with farmers in other African countries.Mohammed Bah Abba personally financed the first 5,000 pot-in-pot systems for his own community and five villages nearby. In 2000, the Rolex Watch Company of Switzerland honored him with the Rolex Award for Enterprise.This award recognizes people trying to develop projects aimed at improving human knowledge and well-being.A committee considers projects in science and medicine, technology, exploration and discovery, the environment and cultural history.Winners receive financial assistance to help develop and extend their projects.The award is given every two years.The most recent one was given last year.

215,"Polluted airborne particles  kill 7 million people a year, reports the World Health Organization. That news may not come as a surprise to anyone who has seen images of chimneys in Beijing, Delhi or Mexico. But those factories-or even the jammed roadways of modern cities-are not the biggest killer. Each year, some 4.3 million people die earlier than they should because of polluted air inside their homes, says the WHO. What's causing the air inside people's homes to be so poisonous that it kills around 11,000 people a day? Stoves. ""Having an open fire in your kitchen is like burning 400 cigarettes an hour."" says Kirk Smith, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, whose research suggests that household air pollution from cooking killed between 3.5 million and 4 million people in 2013. Not all stoves cause this kind of harm. The ones Smith's talking about are those that the 3 billion people in the developing world use for heat and cooking, which burn solid fuels such as wood, coal, or crop waste instead of gas. The smoke from those fires produces harmful fine particles and carbon monoxide into homes. Poor _ then prevents that smoke from escaping, raising fine particle levels 100 times higher than the limits that the WHO considers acceptable. Breathing this air day in day out eventually causes a lot of diseases: more than a third of the 4.3 million die of a stroke, while a quarter die of heart disease. And around one-third of annual lung disease deaths worldwide are due to waste from coal stoves. Exposure tends to be extremely harmful for the people who spend the most time around the fire-usually women and young children. In fact, the WHO reports that household air pollution almost doubles the risk for childhood lung disease.

Doesn't the success of these films indicate that the story has relevance to children even today?"" Yes,, admits Ellen, who sees its message as being rooted in a fundamental childhood desire for love and attention."" Most children experience a sense of inner loneliness as they are growing up and empathize with (...)the character who faces some sort of challenge.This can be seen in the original story of Cinderella, where the fairy godmother tells the heroine that she must learn to be gracious and confident if she is to go to the ball.She has to grow spiritually, and by maturing, she becomes attractive to the prince, thus ensuring that the ending of the story will be happy."" ""In the later versions, thus element is missing,"" says Ellen, "" and the theme of the story is simply that a girl' s role in life is to be more beautiful than other girls so that she can carry off the prize: the handsome prince.Is this really what we want girls to grow up believing?"" Why does Ellen disapprove of the Cinderella story?",The plot is too simple.,The description is not vivid.,The heroine is not brave enough.,The story is unfit for the children today.,C
218,"Dear Mr. Plant, I am an enthusiastic camper and longtime X-Ports customer, but after being offended for the third time at your Sierra Vista location, I am writing to complain about your impolite employees. Several months ago ,I bought a tent that leaked the first time I used it and wanted it replaced .  When I took it back, your employees accused me of tearing it myself. I left not only withm1, torn tent, but no refund  and no satisfaction. A  couple of weeks ago ,  I bought a sleeping bag that was supposed to sleep two people comfort-ably.  It didn't.  Your employees refused to give me my money back even though I had the receipt. I was asked to leave the store, again with no satisfaction. To my misfortune, my latest purchase , of a piece of camping equipment at your store proyed to be another disappointment.  The propane    camp stove I bought didn't work properly. When I returned to exchange it, the rude clerk refused to help me because I did not have my sales receipt. It was an even exchange! He said that I was a problem and even asked if I had seen what products I-could purchase at one of your competitor's stores at comparable prices.  Was he accusing me of something? Why would I have brought a receipt for an even exchange? Why  would I know the price at other stores? Furthermore, the clerk called security and forced me to leave your store-without my camp stove! How can I go camping now? The tent leaks, the sleeping bag is just wrong, and I don't have a stove to keep warm ! Who is going to refund my money for my stove? Who is going to help me get over the abuse I suffered in your store? You, as the area manager must clear these matters up for me immediately!

219,"If you love reading books, you must know about the book The Little Prince. It's a famous novel written by a French writer. As one of the best-selling books in history, it has been sold as many as 200 million copies in 253 languages and dialects . Now, around seventy years after the birth of the book, an American director has found a way to make it into a 3D animated film. The book tells the story of a pilot, called The Aviator, who crashes into the desert and meets a young prince there. However, in the film, the story starts years after the crash when The Aviator is much older. He has got a new neighbor called The Little Girl, whose mother wants her to get ready to enter the grown-up world. Slowly, the Aviator shares his story with The Little Girl by writing it down and sending her a page at a time. The pages are complete with the pictures in the book, speaking about his time in the desert and taking The Little Girl to an amazing world where anything is possible. China is the first country in the world to see the film in two versions--in Chinese and English. The film shows The Little Girl's life and tells The Little Prince's story at the same time in a beautiful way. Huang Lei, who voices the film together with his 9-year-old daughter, says the film is like a childhood dream which is lost by most adults in this stressed-out society. ""The most touching part is that every one of us was a good-natured kid like the Little Prince, and it's a pity that this good characteristic goes away as time flies,"" he says. , The novel The Little Prince was written in the  _  .",1900s,1940s,1990s,2010s,B
220,"The search for life in the universe took a step forward last month with the opening of the Allen Telescope Array  in Hat Creek, California. The telescopes were partly made possible by a gift of twenty-five million dollars from Paul Allen. The total cost of the project is already fifty million dollars. At present, there are 42 radio telescopes working at the Hat Creek observatory. The signals they receive are combined to create what is equal to a single, very large telescope. The telescope will be used to observe objects like exploding stars, black holes and other objects that are predicted but have not yet been observed. Seth Shostak of the SETI Institute says this is the first telescope whose main purpose is to search for signals from intelligent life in space. The SETI Institute is based in Mountain View, California. The organization supports the search for other life forms in the universe. What makes the Allen Telescope Array unusual is that it can collect and study information from a wide area of the sky. In addition, the 42 telescopes can study information about several projects at the same time. That means studies of large areas of the sky can be made faster than ever before. Some officials think the Allen Telescope Array will be completed in three more years. 350 individual radio telescopes are planned. The new abilities of the Allen Telescope Array will make searching for stars similar to the sun much faster. An earlier search by SETI, Project Phoenix, studied about 800 stars to a distance of 240 light years. The project ended in 2004. With the Allen Telescope Array, astronomers hope to gather thousands of times more information in the search for life beyond our planet. Which of the following is TRUE according to this passage?",The Allen Telescope Array takes much more room than former telescopes.,The Allen Telescope Array is still being built at present in the United States.,Another 42 radio telescopes will be fixed in the Allen Telescope Array.,The SETI Institute is against the search for other life forms in the universes.,B
221,"Everyone seems to be in favor of progress. But ""progress"" is a funny word. It doesn't necessarily mean that something has become stronger, wiser or better. It simply means changing it from being one thing to another and sometimes it turns out to be worse than before.   Consider medicine, for instance. No one can deny  that medical progress has enriched our lives greatly. Because of medical advancements, we eat better, live easier and are able to take care of ourselves more efficiently. We can cure disease with no more than one injection  or a pill. If we have a serious accident, doctors can put us back together again. If we are born with something defective  , they can repair it. They can ease our pain, replace worn parts and give us children. They can even bring us back from death. These are wonderful achievements, but there is a price we have to pay.    Because medicine has reduced death, the population has been rising steadily, in spite of serious efforts to reduce the rate of population growth. A child born in the United States today has better than a 90% chance of survival . Furthermore, medical advances have ensured that most of those new-born children will live to be seventy years of age or more. The result of this progress is a great population increase that threatens  the quality of life, brought about by progress in the medical profession .

222,"""Everything happens for the best."" Whenever I faced disappointment, my mother would say this to me. After I graduated form college in 1932, I decided to find a job in radio as a sports announcer . I went to Chicago and knocked at the door of every station. But unluckily, I was refused every time. At one station, a kind lady told me that big stations wouldn't hire  a person without any experience and suggested that I try my luck at smaller stations. Following her advice, I went back to Dixon, where I had grown up. There were no such jobs in Dixon, and my father said a newly-opened store wanted a local athlete to work for it. I wanted this job, but I was refused again. ""Everything happens for the best,"" Mom reminded me. Dad offered me the car to look for a job. I tried WOC Radio in Davenport, Iowa. The program director, Peter MacArthur, told me they had already hired an announcer. As I left his office, I felt so frustrated. ""How can I become a sports announcer if I can't get a job in a radio station?"" I asked aloud. While I was waiting for the elevator, I heard someone calling. It was MacArthur. ""What was that you said about sports? Do you know anything about football?"" Then he asked me to have a try. He was pleased with my performance, and he offered me a chance to work there. On my way home, I thought of my mother's words: ""If you carry on, one day something good will happen. Something wouldn't have happened if without the failure before."" Why couldn't the writer find a job at big radio stations?",Because he never graduated from college.,Because he didn't work hard in college.,Because he didn't have much experience.,Because he didn't know about sports.,C
223,"When I was three, my parents took me to have an operation in India, which stopped my eyesight from deteriorating . Several years later we moved to Pakistan, where I received 12 operations within one year and went completely blind. Later, I realized that the doctors used me as an experiment. I met my husband when he came over from India to study. I wanted to go to India to marry him, but it was almost impossible to emigrate. I made a crazy plan to cross the borders of several countries to get to India. I was arrested in the first country I escaped to. Back in Pakistan, I lost my job and was asked to sign a ""never-to-escape"" promise. Instead, when I got home, I made a cup of coffee and decided to make a formal application for emigration. _ , and people who applied to go to India found it hard to find a job in Pakistan while they were waiting. In the end, my husband managed to smooth the way for my emigration. We got married and had children. But after nine years, he died of brain cancer. I was helpless for a while, and then I learned to face reality optimistically. He taught us happiness came from inside us. Six years ago, I brought home a dog called Moritz from the seeing-eye dog centre. He was short with long ears. No one liked him because of his pathetic appearance. We were almost always together. Moritz could not leave me for even one minute. Now when I walk down the street, not like before, people will come up and say, ""What a good seeing-eye dog!"", and have a little chat with me as a normal creature.

224,"Uncertainty spreads through our lives so thoroughly that it dominates our language. Our everyday speech is made up in large part of words like probably, many, soon, great, little. What do these words mean?Such verbal expression is not necessarily to be criticized. Indeed, it has a value just because it allows us to express judgments when a precise quantitative statement is out of the question. We have been trying to pin down by experiments what people mean by these expressions in specific contexts, and how the meanings change with age. For instance, a subject is told ""There are many trees in the park"" and is asked to say what number the word many mean to him. Or a child is invited to take ""some"" sweets from a bowl and we then count how many he has taken. We compare the number he takes when he is alone with the number when one or more other children are present and are to take some sweets after him, or with the number he takes when told to give ""some"" sweets to another child. First, we find that the number depends, of course, on the items involved. To most people some friends means about five, while some trees means about twenty. However, unrelated areas sometimes show parallel values. For instance, the language of probability seems to mean about the same thing in predictions about the weather and about politics: the expression ""is certain to"" (rain, or be elected) signifies to the average person about a 70 percent chance; ""is likely to"", about a 60 percent chance; ""probably will"" about 55 percent. Secondly, the size of the population of items influences the value assigned to an expression. Thus, if we tell a subject to take ""a few"" or "" a lot of"" glass balls from a box, he will take more if the box contains a large number of glass balls than if it has a small number. But not proportionately more: if we increase the number of glass balls eight times, the subject takes only half as large a percentage of the total. Thirdly, there is a marked change with age. Among children between six and fourteen years old, the older the child, the fewer glass balls he will take. But the difference between a lot and a few widens with age. This age effect is so consistent that it might be used as a test of intelligence. What will tell us about the intelligence of a child?",The consistency of picking up a certain glass ball.,How many glass balls he will take when he's asked to.,The difference between a lot and a few when he takes glass balls.,Whether there are marked changes in his first pick and second one.,C
225,"The Internet is not perfect. There are many problems with it. The Internet is not organized. There is no one in charge of the Internet. It is sometimes difficult to find what you are looking for. It is also easy to get the wrong information on the ""Net"". Some businessmen cheat people on the Internet. Internet thieves can steal credit card numbers. Some advertisers send spam to e-mail boxes. E-mail boxes are often filled with these unwanted advertisements. Illegal businesses can operate on the Internet. These businesses sell X-rated materials, cigarettes and alcohol to teenagers. The Internet has websites with information about making bombs, breaking the law and terrorism. Criminals can fool people, especially children, in chat rooms. They can spread poisonous information and attack new members. The Internet is the greatest advance in communication since human emerged. But it can also like a dark alley in a dangerous part of town. Parents need to set parental controls on their children when they use the Internet. This will keep some of the bad material away from their children. The Internet can be dangerous to computers, too. Some people who have evil intentions enjoy causing problems for other people they don't even know. They create computer viruses. A computer can get virus by downloading a program that has a virus in it. Some virus come by e-mail. A virus can destroy the data a person has saved in computer files.

228,"As nanny , cook, cleaner, shopper, driver, and gardener, she has one of the most demanding jobs in Britain today. And paying someone else to do the chores  which take the average housewife 71 hours a week would cost EUR349. At over EUR18,000 a year that's more than the earnings of 70 percent of the population, including train drivers, firemen, prison officers, and social worker. Looking after a baby less than a year old takes a housewife into a even higher pay league. According to a stud, she earns EUR457 a week - at nearly EUR24,000 a year, the same as teachers, engineers, and chemists. Researchers put a price on each chore, then tried to find out how long the average person takes doing them. They found housewives spend an average 70.7 hours a week on housework - with looking after the children (17.9hours) and cooking and cleaning (12.9 hours each) the most time-consuming . A wife with a part-time job still works and average of 59 hours a week at home. Those in full-time employment put in longer hours at home than in the workplace. The good news is that these hours sharply as children get older. While the average mother with child under one puts in 90 hours weekly, the figure drops to 80 hours from one to four and to 66 hours from five to ten. Mother-of-four Karen Williams from London said, ""Paying the housewives may not be practical, but the government should recognize the value of housework, perhaps through the tax. Running a house takes a lot of time and most husbands don't understand this. For example, my husband only puts a shelf up now and again. He never cleans the kitchen - that's the real test.""

229,"In many businesses, computers have largely replaced paperwork, because they are fast, flexible, and do not make mistakes. As one banker said, ""Unlike humans, computers never have a bad day."" And they are honest. Many banks advertise that their transactions are ""untouched by human hands"" and therefore safe from human temptation. Obviously, computers have no reason to steal money. But they also have no conscience, and the growing number of computer crimes shows they can be used to steal. Computer criminals don't use guns. And even they are caught, it is hard to punish them because there are no witnesses and often no evidence. A computer cannot remember who used it: it simply does what it is told. The head teller at a New York City Bank used a computer to steal more than one and a half billion dollars in just four years. No one noticed this theft because he moved the money from one account to another. Each time a customer he had robbed questioned the balance in his account, the teller claimed a computer error, then replaced the missing money from someone else's account. This man was caught only because he was a gambler. When the police broke up an illegal gambling operation, his name was in the records. Some employees use the computer's power to get revenge on employers they consider unfair. Recently, a large insurance company fired its computer-tape librarian for reasons that involved her personal rather than her professional life. She was given thirty days' notice. In those thirty days, she erased all the company's computerized records. Most computer criminals have been minor employees. Now police wonder if this is ""the tip of the iceberg"". As one official says, ""I have the feeling that there is more crime out there than we are catching. What we are seeing now is all so poorly done. I wonder what the real experts are doing--the ones who really know how a computer works.""

233,"""You know, Chihuahuas aren't actual dogs. They're a kind of fox,"" announced a woman at a party. This woman entirely believed that Chihuahuas are the descendants   of the Fennec fox. Many people might believe this: Chihuahuas are similar to foxes in their appearance with long-haired Chihuahuas appearing almost indistinguishable from their wild counterparts . The idea that Chihuahuas are related to foxes isn't uncommon. Even the American Kennel Club, which is usually a highly respected source of information, accepts the belief and the similarity between Chihuahuas and Fennec foxes. Interesting as it is to imagine that Chihuahuas are a breed   of the fox, this idea simply can't hold water. Chihuahuas are, in fact, far more closely related to dingoes  or wolves than they are to Fennec foxes. Like other dogs, Chihuahuas are able to breed with other members within the same species. The Fennec fox is a member of a different species. Chihuahuas and Fennec foxes are fairly distantly related just like a cat and a tiger are. Their similarities occur only because of a phenomenon known as convergent evolution , in which animals develop similar features to meet similar biological needs.  A simple observation of geography further denies the idea that Fennec foxes and Chihuahuas are related. While the Fennec fox was living in the deserts of Africa, the Chihuahua came from Mexico, where it got its common name. Its closest living  s are other native Central and South American breeds. Its ancestor, the now nearly-extinct Mexican gray wolf, is also a much closer   to the Chihuahua than any other fox. It is common to consider the cute Chihuahua as a little Fennec fox adapted to life, but this theory is not true. Chihuahuas are domestic  dogs to the same degree as other dogs. Much as a Chihuahua might look like a fox, it is--and always will be--a dog. What can we learn about Chihuahuas from this passage?",Chihuahuas are the descendants of the dingoe.,The features of animals are usually hard to change.,"They are cute, long-haired and much like a fox.",Chihuahuas came from Africa.,C

235,"It was the last time Susan Butcher ran the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in 1992. An hour into the race, Susan and her sled dog team sped down a hill and crashed into a fallen tree. Although hurt, Susan continued the difficult race. The Iditarod Race started in 1925 when a doctor in Nome, Alaska was desperately in need of medicine to stop the spread of a deadly disease. Only a hospital had what he needed, but it was 700 mile-away! In January, it was too dangerous to send a boat and too stormy for his tiny airplane. The only hope was to use several sled dog teams following a trail, called the Iditarod Trail. They passed the medicine from one sled team to another. Wind and snow did not stop the men and their dogs. The medicine was delivered in record time. The race follows the route of the famous medicine run. Over 1,000 miles long, it is considered the toughest race in the world. Susan Butcher was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In her teens Susan was given a Siberian husky dog and became very interested in huskies as sled dogs. After reading about the Iditarod Race, Susan moved to Alaska. She got several jobs to earn money to buy herself a sled and a team of huskies. After years of hard work and training, Susan achieved her dream of racing on the Iditarod Trail.

236,"We are not born doubting ourselves. We learn to do it. In fact, we are usually taught to doubt ourselves. We can learn some ways that allow us to become more accepting of ourselves. Following are two behaviors that might explain the reasons why you can't move towards greater self-acceptance. One thing that might cause you not to accept yourself is over-generalizing about something you've done that you don't like.For example, if you fail a test you might generalize and say, ""I'm really a stupid person."" When you do this you are making a statement about all of you all of the time and not just about this one situation at this time. Instead, you might decide that your grade on this test in this subject at this time was indeed poor, and then go on to decide what you want to do about your poor grade, if anything. Getting stuck in over-generalizing discourages you from taking steps that might allow you to do better on the next exam and to build an expectation of future failure.  Having standards that are impossibly high is a second way you can not accept yourself. It may not come as a surprise to you that most of us are more demanding of ourselves than we are of others. Somehow we can tolerate the fact that other people fail, that they aren't always kind, that they've done things they aren't proud of, but we have difficulty accepting those very human aspects of ourselves. The need to be perfect is another way to set yourself up for failure and enhance the feeling that you are not acceptable. We all make mistakes. Accepting less than perfection simply means recognizing the limitations natural in being born a human being. Learn to value who you are rather than who you could become. Wouldn't it be overpowering if we always had to do what we imagine we could do? Nobody has the time and energy to do all of that. We must make choices about what we will pursue and do them the best we can under the circumstances, which aren't always ideal, by the way. What has caused the lack of self-acceptance?",Tolerance and high-level.,Limitation and expectation.,Over-generalization and high-standard.,Extreme difficulty and complete failure.,C

The death was announced by company that Mr.Jobs and his high school friend Stephen Wozniak started in 1976 in a suburban California garage.   Jobs was born in San Francisco and adopted at birth by Paul Jobs and Clara Jobs. Paul Jobs taught his son basic electronics and how to work his hands. Asked in a 1995 interview what he wanted to pass on to his children, Jobs replied,""Just to try to be as good a father to them as my father was to me."" Following high school graduation in 1972, Jobs was admitted to Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Although he dropped out after only one semester, he continued taking classes at Reed, sleeping on the floor in friend' rooms, returning Coke bottles for food money, and getting weekly free meals at the local temple. In the late 1970s, they designed, developed, and marketed one of the first commercially successful personal computers. The Apple II series. In 1985, after losing a power struggle, Jobs left Apple and founded NeXT, a computer platform development company specializing in the higher-education and business markets. In 1986, he put money in and produced Toy Story (1995), making Jobs Disney's largest shareholder at seventy percent. Apple's 1996 buyout of NeXT brought Jobs back to the company.

239,"His eyes nearly in tears from the crush of fellow travelers at Guangzhou's train station, Hong Tao said things were much better on Sunday, after days of waiting for a train to his home in Hubei province. ""I think it's fine today, and everything is going smoothly,"" the 28-year-old said. ""I thought it would be really crowded but it has turned out to be OK."" Chinese authorities say they expect 1.3 million people to travel out of Guangzhou's train station over the next few days, as they rush to get home by Wednesday, the eve of Lunar New Year. Hong's optimism may have been helped by the blue skies that emerged over Guangzhou on Sunday for the first time in a week. Last week, a rare winter storm paralyzed China's transportation system as millions tried to get home to celebrate the holiday -- the only chance for many migrant workers to see their families all year. China's state-run Xinhua news agency said Friday that 95 percent of rail traffic had ""returned to normal."" But Guangzhou's train station remained packed with a backlog of hundreds of thousands of travelers hoping to get home for the holiday. A young woman was stepped on in a stampede   at the train station Friday, and later died of her injuries, according to Xinhua. Video of the situation on Friday showed crowds of people screaming, elbowing each other, in some cases sobbing and collapsing in the rush to get a slot (,) on a train. China Sunday announced it has organized over 300,000 People's Liberation Army forces to southern China in what it described as a ""war on winter weather"".

These paintings are painted by Wang Yue, 23, a college student at Dalian Polytechnic University. Wang describes her tree hole paintings as ""a beautiful journey"" through which she adds fun to her hometown. ""When I saw that the trees by the roadside had lost all their leaves, the ugly tree holes became obvious ,"" she said. ""I thought if I could paint some interesting scenes in these holes they might add some color to the city. "" But Wang was worried that the pigments  in her watercolors could hurt the trees. After asking environmental specialists and getting permission from city officials, Wang gathered her color palette , brushes and other things to get to work. ""Painting on a tree hole is not as easy as painting on a canvas . I had to think about the shapes and sizes of the tree holes and adjust my designs accordingly,"" she said. ""Before I began, I also had to clean off the dust from the tree holes first."" ""I was glad to let people see life's beauty. I hope more artists can join me in painting the tree holes,"" Wang said.

241,"When I was in college, a man named Henry worked as a custodian  in our student union building. White-haired, with a Pennsylvania Dutch accent, Henry could usually be seen in a baseball cap, a T-shirt and a pair of jeans. He was the custodian, and he was the most respected and most well-known person in the building. Everyone loved Henry, and it was because of all the implicit ways he expressed his love for everyone around him. Henry didn't have to say, ""I love you."" He lived his love. Henry was always excited when he met someone new, and he wanted to know everything about them. He felt it was important to do things for people he valued. And Henry seemed to value everyone he met. He brought in articles or cartoons for certain people, went out of his way to introduce people to each other, kept dozens of names and birthdays in his wallet so he could send cards, and helped students keep in touch with graduates who had written to him. He even assisted students who didn't have enough money to buy their books.  Henry taught me --- and many others he supported --- how to live life to the fullest. Not by skydiving or exploring some foreign countries, but by appreciating where you are in life and valuing those around you. The funny thing is that despite all he did and taught us, Henry truly believed that he was the lucky one --- that he was the one who was gaining so much by getting to know us. But all of us who remember Henry know that we were the ones who were truly blessed.  We will never forget the man who taught us that best way to say ""I love you"" often has little to do with the words. Which of the following word cannot be used to describe Henry?",Gracious.,Adventurous.,Supportive.,Sympathetic.,B
242,"""Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,"" grumbled Jo, lying on the rug.  ""It's so dreadful to be poor!"" sighed Meg, looking down at her old dress.  ""I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things, and other girls nothing at all,"" added little Amy, with an injured sniff.  ""We've got father and mother and each other,"" said Beth, contentedly.  The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly: ""We haven't got father, and shall not have him for a long time."" She didn't say ""perhaps never"", but each silently added it, thinking of father far away, where the fighting was.  Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone: ""You know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone; and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure when our men are suffering so in the army. We can't do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don't""; and Meg shook her head, and she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.  ""But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good. We've each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving that. I agree not to expect anything from mother or you, but I do want to buy UNDINE AND SINTRAM for myself; I've wanted it so long,"" said Jo, who was a bookworm.  ""I planned to spend mine on new music,"" said Beth, with a little sigh.  ""I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils; I really need them,"" said Amy, decidedly.  ""Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to give up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and have a little fun; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it,"" cried Jo, examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.  ""I know I do - teaching those tiresome children nearly all day when I am longing to enjoy myself at home,"" began Meg, in the complaining tone again.  ""You don't have half such a hard time as I do,"" said Jo. ""How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to fly out of the window or cry?"" ""It's naughty to fret; but I do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world.  _ and my hands get so stiff, I can't practice well at all""; and Beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that anyone could hear. ""I don't believe any of you suffer as I do."" cried Amy, ""for you don't have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your father if he isn't rich."" ""If you mean libel, I'd say so, and not talk about labels, as if papa was a pickle-bottle,"" advised Jo, laughing.  ""I know what I mean, and you needn't be satirical about it.

244,"Phys ed (physical education) is making a comeback as a part of the school core curriculum ,but with a difference. While group sports are still part of the curriculum, the new way is to teach skills that are useful beyond gym class. Instead of learning how to climb a rope, children are taught to lift weights, balance their diets and build physical endurance . In this way,kids are given the tools and skills and experiences so they can lead a physically active life for the rest of their life. Considering that 15 percent of American children aged 6 to 18 are overweight, supporters say more money and thought must be put into phys ed curriculum. In many cases, that may mean not just replacing the old gym-class model with fitness programs but also starting up phys ed programs because school boards often ""put P.E. on the chopping block  , cutting it entirely or decreasing its teachers or the days it is offered,"" says Alicia Moag-Stahlberg, the executive director of Action for Health Kids. The difference in phys ed programs is partly due to the lack of a national standard. ""Physical education needs to be part of the core curriculum,"" she added. The wisdom of the new approach has some scientific support. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin have showed how effective the fit-for-life model of gym class can be. They observed how 50 overweight children lost more weight when they cycled and skied cross-country  than when they played sports. The researchers also found that teaching sports like football resulted in less overall movement, partly because some reluctant students were able to sit on the bench. Another problem with simply teaching group sports in gym class is that only a small percentage of students continue playing them after graduating from high school. The new method teaches skills that translate to adulthood. What does Alicia Moag-Stahlberg mean by saying ""some school boards put P. E. on the chopping block""?",Schools do not pay enough attention to P. E..,Schools welcome P. E. but do not have time for it.,Schools put P.E. in the first place.,Schools cut down other subjects' time for P. E..,A
245,"The audience nodded in agreement when the speaker, a teacher from a community college, said, ""High school English teachers are not doing their jobs."" He described the shortcomings of his students, all high school graduates who can use language only at Grade 9 level. I was unable to determine from his answers to my questions ho. w this grade 9 level had been raised.  My topic is neither standards nor its decline . What the speaker was really saying is that he is no longer young; he has been teaching for sixteen years, and is able to think and speak like an adult.  My point is that the frequent complaint of one generation about the next is unavoidable. It is also human nature to look for the reason for our dissatisfaction. Before English became a school subject in the late nineteenth century, it was difficult to find the target of the blame for language limitation. But since then, English teachers have been under constant attack.  The complainers think they have hit upon an original idea. As their own command of the language improves, they notice that young people do not have this same ability. Unaware that their own ability has developed through the years, they take as true the new generation of young people must be hopeless in this respect. To the eyes and ears of adults the language of the young never seems enough.  Since this concern about the fall of the English language is not taken as a generation phenomenon but rather as something new to today's young people, it naturally follows that today's English teachers cannot be doing their jobs. Otherwise, young people would not make mistakes of the language. It can be concluded from the passage that",it is suitable to include English as a school subject,the author agrees with the speaker over the standard of English at Grade 9 level,English language teaching is an easy job,language improvement needs time and effort,D
246,"A single night of taking the drug Ecstasy   can cause serious brain damage and speed up the start of Parkinson's disease , scientists say. Just two or three Ecstasy tablets can permanently destroy brain cells that affect movement and reasoning, according to American research that links the drug to Parkinson's for the first time. A study by a team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, involving squirrel monkeys and baboons   found that both species suffered permanent damage to key cells, which are lost in Parkinson's, after receiving three low doses of Ecstasy at three-hour periods. The study is particularly important because baboons are one of the best animal models for the human brain. George Ricaurte, who led the research, said that the widespread abuse of drug might have caused severe damage. ""The most troubling result is that young adults using Ecstasy may be increasing their risk of developing Parkinsonism as they get older."" Alan Leshner, a former director of the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, said, ""This study emphasizes the multi-aspect damage that Ecstasy causes to users. We've long known that repeated use damages brain cells. But this study shows that even very occasional  use can have long-lasting effects on many different brain systems. It sends an important message to young people: don't experiment with your own brain."" Janet Betts, a mother whose teenage daughter Leah died after a single Ecstasy tablet in 1995, said, ""This comes as no surprise.

250,"Elaine Yu Yee-nee, 15, Creative Secondary School Lockers are designed in a way to hide their contents for a reason. Otherwise, they'd have open fronts like cupboards. Searching students' lockers would be total invasion  of privacy. Having a locker is more than having a place to store your stuff. A locker also gives you the freedom to keep certain things hidden. These can include harmless personal items like diaries, letters and photos. Searching lockers could _ students and others might make fun of them. Yes, lockers are school property . But that doesn't give schools the right to inspect lockers as they please. While students are using lockers, they have the right to keep their contents private. Teachers could ask for permission to take a look inside a student's locker and if the student is OK with that, then it would be fine. Searching students' lockers without their permission would result in the loss of trust. I doubt that students who have something dangerous to hide, such as weapons or drugs, would put them in their lockers. They would not want to risk being caught so easily. Giving schools the right to search lockers would not help catch those who commit crimes. But it would certainly create an environment in which students would be embarrassed to have their belongings shown in public for no good reason. Ronald Ling Pak-ki, 20, University of Hong Kong Many students see their lockers as personal property. They would never agree that schools should have the right to inspect their lockers. But I think schools have an absolute right to do so. It is the schools that actually own the lockers. Students just use them to store some of their things safely and conveniently. There are clear rules on what items students can and cannot keep in their lockers. Schools have both the duty and the right to check if students are following the rules. I don't think school authorities would decide to search a student's locker unless they felt the need to do so. They might, for instance, suspect students of hiding drugs. To make sure that the process remains open and fair, only authorized teachers should have the right to search lockers. The search should be carried out in such a way as not to embarrass students in front of others. According to Elaine, school lockers   _  .",are students' personal property,should be changed into cupboards,are likely to hold some dangerous things,can be searched with students' permission,D

It's reported that a Nepali teenager has designed a $32 solar panel using human hair. Milan Karki,who is 18 years old and lives in a village in rural Nepal,used human hair to replace silicon ,which is a common but expensive componet of solar panels. By using hair as a replacement,Karki says that solar panels can be produced for around $32,a price that could be halved if they were mass-produced. The solar panel works,because melanin ,which gives hair its colour,is light sensitive and can act as an elecrtical conductor.Kaiki was inspired to think of the idea by a Stephen Hawking book ,which explained how to create elecrtic energy from hair. The device that Karki has invented is capable of producing 9V or 18V of energy--plenty to charge a mobile phone. ""Half a kilo of hair can be bought for only 16p in Nepal and lasts a few months;whereas a pack of batteries would cost50p and lasts few nights,""according to The Daily Mail. The solar panel is claimed to be easy to service as the hair is easy to replace.

253,"Recently, we were given the opportunity to review a book written by a young author. When we received it, I noted how beautifully done it was. While often the case---we see beautifully written and illustrated books all the time---but how often do they come from a 10-year-old? Sewing a Friendship, written by a creative and talented young girl named Natalie Tinti, is such a book. Developing friendships is an area that Natalie Tinti has researched in her own life. In her book, Sewing a Friendship, she tells what great things can happen if kids take a step toward friendship. Tinti's characters in Sewing a Friendship have colorful and creative personalities. Jonsy Jipsy loves singing and belly dance. Sokron Blossom lives in a neat and tidy world and loves to read fashion magazines. Meeka likes brain games and Nina is happy with her life and the music it brings her. All but one of the characters seems happy with their lives. One of the girls, Kiki Shaver, was sad to live in a small home with her aunt and uncle. She had no friend and didn't know how to make them. When four girls invites her into the circle of their friendship, it's no wonder that Kiki is hesitant and uneasy. The story continues as the four girls invite and accept a "" not so likeable"" girl into their circle to win a fashion show. The girls feel a strong bond of friendship after the show. Kiki then understands that taking a step towards friendship is better than being alone. All the girls learn that by having the courage to include others, you can "" sew a friendship"". Today, it seems that almost every news headline begins with a child's suicide---or murder---because of being bullied ,not having friends or family to discuss issues with and feelings of low self -respect. What's causing these senseless terrible events? If more kids would invite the outcasts  into their circle of friends, lives would be saved as well as pointed in another direction.

255,"More perhaps than any other European nation, the Swiss are accustomed to looking after foreign travelers. As early as the 18th century, wealthy French, Germans and Italians were treating the country as a amusement center while, in the 19th century, it became the major holiday playground for the British nobles. Today, it attracts visitors from all over the world. The Swiss are clear about the importance of tourism to their economy, which contributes about eight percent of Gross National Product, and helps the industry greatly. Managers of hotels the world over go to Switzerland to learn how to do the job, and a generally high standard can be expected from the great majority of the country's hotels, most of which are small and pride themselves on a personalized service. Public transport is the best in Europe. Both the Swiss Federal railways and the private railways are fully electrified, and the total network is made up of about 5000 kilometers of track. Under the Fly Baggage system passengers can check luggage in at 116 railway stations and have it automatically carried to their flight. The national highway system is equally well planned, and the mountain roads offer views of some of the country's most breathtaking scenery. Also serving the mountains is an effective system of railways and cable ways, while more than 160 passenger cars cross the lakes and rivers to and fro. Hiking in the mountains is equally popular with Swiss nationals and foreign visitors.

257,"In Los Angeles, drivers spend sixty-one hours every year stuck in traffic.These drivers know all too well how bad the traffic can be.""There're too many cars, and you can't move around a lot."" Professor Cyrus Shahabi also knows about traffic jams.He lives more than 65 kilometers from his office at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles.He is always late even with the help of a navigation   system. He decided to develop a program called ClearPath for that.He says his program uses historical data to predict traffic conditions even before the driver leaves the house. ""What's unique is that we use a lot of data that's currently become available including traffic data, weather data, and we analyze that so that we can predict what's going to happen in front of you when you leave home."" Professor Shahabi says his system does more than just respond to current traffic conditions.With ClearPath, he says, a driver can decide what time he wants to leave, and ClearPath will give the fastest route.It looks at the entire road network, including surface streets as well as highways, before the driver hits the road.Professor Shahabi hopes to have ClearPath available nationwide and overseas once they can collect traffic data from other cities. ""I always thought thatLos Angeles had the worst traffic, but now I know that Shanghai, Beijing, Seoul, Tokyo, believe it or not, Singapore, Hong Kong certainly are examples that can immediately use this."" Professor Shahabi hopes to share this new technology with companies that already have navigation systems, such as Google and Apple. What is unique about ClearPath?",It can use a lot of information all over the world.,It can ensure that you will never be late for work.,It helps drivers see clearly what happens on the road.,It helps drivers know the road conditions ahead of time.,D

The summer vacation is the best part   of the year for most children. The weather is usually fine. They can swim, go to summer camp or visit other places with their parents. Of course, the beaches are good places for relaxing. Some children are lucky to live near the sea. They can enjoy the sea anytime  . But for the children far from the sea, they go to the beaches for one or two weeks with their parents. Why do children like spending their summer vacations on the beaches?

259,"Q: My daughter is a junior in high school and has been on an individualized education program since fourth grade. She plans to go to college and intends to finish with a master's degree. Her performance in general is fairly good, but test scores are very low. She has held many leadership and volunteer positions. We have been advised to have her write an essay about how her learning disability is a barrier that she has to get over. Will that help or hurt her chances for admission? ---- Deborah A: First let me answer the question on low standardized test scores (ACT/SAT). There are hundreds of colleges that are ""test optional"" which means students can choose not to release their test scores in the application process. Admission decisions at these colleges for students who do not submit their test scores are made based on other factors. A list of test optional colleges can be found at fairtest.org. It is important, however, to make sure that the college is the right fit academically regardless of the test optional policy. You also asked if your daughter should write about her disability and if this would hurt her chances of being admitted. Please know that colleges do not deny admission based on disability. ""Disclosing"" a learning disability in a personal statement within the college application can certainly help. By writing a personal statement, students can potentially _ , for example, their understanding of the challenge they face. They might also prove an improved grade trend in that subject area, and show interest in more complex courses in spite of this disability. More importantly, a student disclosure can show self-confidence, motivation and an understanding of the disability. ---- Ms. Kravis According to the passage, Mr. Kravis is probably   _  .",an editor,a school leader,a psychological doctor,an educational expert,D

267,"Women work harder than men at university and get better degrees as a result, according to a study at Brunel University. The research, which followed 200 students for four years, found that women consistently outperformed men in their studies even though they had started their courses with almost identical A-level grades. An analysis of the results showed that while 65 percent of female graduates were awarded, only 35 percent of male graduates did as well. Girls are known to outperform boys at school, but this research showed that trend continued at university. Fiona Smith, who led the research, said, ""The research shows that the difference has something to do with schools in general."" ""It also shows something about the inequality for working women in terms of pay and promotion. Women work harder at school, harder at university, and do better at both, but they still receive less pay."" The research found that female students were more faithful, less likely to miss lectures, and more likely to believe that their marks reflected their abilities than male students. Female students were also more likely to ask for and receive support from their professors. Women were also more likely to choose their universities because they liked the courses offered. In contrast, men were more likely than women to miss lectures due to ""other affairs"" and ""laziness"", and to believe that playing sports was an important part of university life. Generally, people think that women's success comes from more emphasis on coursework, but the research showed that female geographers at Brunel did better in their exams than in their coursework. Dr Smith said, ""Most women feel that getting good grades is the most important part of university life. They believe that they need to work harder in order to compete in the male-dominated   environment they will encounter at work. Good grades are viewed as an 'insurance policy' for success. Men, on the other hand, prefer going out and playing sports to academic work."" ""This research shows how important it is to get all young people working hard and teach them the value of higher education,"" he said. We can infer from the results of the research that   _  .",women do better both at school and at university,female students are more likely to ask for and receive support from their professors,"compared with men, women are in an unfavorable condition in the male-dominated world",it's easier for women to get rises in pay and promotion,C
268,"Spider webs are one of the most fascinating examples of animal architecture. The most beautiful and structurally ordered are the round webs. The main function of the web is to stop and hold flying insects,long enough for the spider to catch them. In order to do so,the threads of the web have to stand the forces from large and heavy insects as well as environmental forces from wind and rain for at least a day in most cases. The round web is found to have two main characteristics. The first is its geometry,which consists of an outer frame and a central part from which threads radiate outward. Enclosed in the frame are capture spirals winding round and round from the web center out to the frame. The whole web is in tension and held in place by anchor threads,which connect the frame to the surrounding plants or objects. The second and perhaps most important characteristic is the material with which it is built. Spider silk is a kind of natural material that gives this lightweight fiber a strength comparable to that of steel, while at the same time making it very elastic . Two types of silk threads are used in the web. One is highly elastic and can stretch to almost twice its original length before breaking and, for most types of spiders, is covered in glue. This type is used in the capture spiral for catching and holding insects. The other is stiffer and stronger,and is used for the radius,frames and anchor threads,which allows the web to stand forces and to keep its structural strength through a wide range of environmental conditions. Which of the following best describes the threads used in the capture spiral?",Natural and lightweight.,Strong and stiff.,Smooth and elastic.,"Strong,sticky and elastic.",D
269,"Money is the root of all evil and new study claims there may be some truth behind the saying.Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, US,announced on February 27 that rich people are more likely to do unethical   things, such as lie or cheat, than poorer people. The scientists did a series of eight experiments. They published their findings online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS,<<>> ). They carried out the first two experiments from the sidewalk near Berkeley. They noted that drivers of newer and more expensive cars were more likely to cut in on other cars and pedestrians at crosswalks. Nearly 45 percent of people driving expensive cars ignored a pedestrian compared with only 30 percent of people driving more modest cars. In another experiment, a group of college students was asked if they would do unethical things in various everyday situations. Examples included taking printer paper from work and not telling a salesperson when he or she gave back more change. Students from higher-class families were more likely to act dishonestly. According to the scientists, rich people often think money can get them out of trouble. This makes them less afraid to take risks. It also means they care less about other people's feelings. Finally,it simply makes them greedier.""Higher wealth status seems to make you want even more,and that increased want leads you to bend the rules or break the rules to serve your self-interest,"" said Paul Piff, leading scientist of the study. Piff pointed out that the findings don't mean that all rich people are untrustworthy or that all poor people are honest. He said the experiments were to show how people living in different social situations express their instincts and values in different ways. Why did the scientists do the experiments?",To show how social status affects people's ethics.,To show people's instincts and values in different ways.,"To test whether the saying ""money is the root of all evil"" is true.",To show the difference between higher-class people and lower-class people.,A

Ginny Ruffner almost died in a three-car accident in 1991. No one thought the Seattle-based artist would ever walk or talk again. An award-winning  film documentary explores that period of her life.

271,"Nowadays the U.S. students are sleepy in school because they spend too much time texting, playing video games, watching TV and using the media in other ways. ""Heavy media use interferes with sleep by reducing sleep duration, making it harder to fall asleep, and lowering sleep quality,"" Meilan Zhang, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at El Paso, wrote in her research review in the journal, Sleep Medicine. But the relationship between youth's media use and sleep is not so simple, said Michael Gradisar, who authored both that review and the Sleep Medicine meta-analysis. ""Technology use is the new evidence when we are trying to answer 'Why are school-age children sleeping less?'"" said Mr. Gradisar, an associate professor of psychology at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia. There may be safe limits to technology use, Mr. Gradisar stated. For instance, recent research results indicate that using a bright screen for an hour before bed or even playing violent video games for less than that will not necessarily interfere with teenagers' sleep, he wrote. But longer periods of usage can be harmful to sleep, Mr. Gradisar added. Rather than delaying school start times, he said, the first step should be educating parents about limiting the hours that their children are using technology before bed, and enforcing a consistent bedtime. Early school start times are also commonly blamed for students' sleepiness, especially for adolescents. Secondary schools around the nation and the world have been delaying start times, often with positive results. Mr. Minnich of the TIMSS and PIRLS International Study Center hesitated to put blame to any particular factor. But he did think that cost-saving measures to consolidate bus routes might help explain U.S. students' sleepiness.

Now, a new study in mice may offer some clues into the exercise-cancer paradox. It suggests that exercise may change how the immune system deals with cancer by boosting adrenaline , certain immune cells and other chemicals that, together, can reduce the severity of cancer or fight it off altogether. To try to better understand how exercise can both elevate inflammation and simultaneously protect the body against cancer, scientists at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and other institutions decided to closely examine what happens inside mice at high risk for the disease. So, for the new study, they began by gathering a group of adult lab mice. These animals generally like to run. The scientists then implanted melanoma   skin cancer cells into the mice before providing half of them with running wheels in their cages while the other animals remained sedentary. After four weeks, far fewer of the runners had developed full-blown melanoma than the sedentary mice and those that had been diagnosed with the disease showed fewer and smaller lesions. They drew blood from both the exercising and sedentary animals and cells from any tumors in both groups. As expected, they found much higher levels of the hormone adrenaline in the blood of the exercising animals, especially right after they had been working out on the wheels but also at other times of the day. The body releases adrenaline in response to almost any type of stressful experience, including exercise. They also found higher levels of interleukin-6 in the blood of the runners. This is a substance that is released by working muscles and is believed to both increase and decrease inflammation in the body, depending on where and how it goes to work. Perhaps most important, they found much higher numbers in the bloodstreams of runners than in the sedentary mice of a type of immune cell named natural killer cells that are known to be strong cancer fighters. So the scientists repeated their original experiment multiple times, inducing cancer while allowing some mice to run and others to sit. In some of these follow-up experiments, the scientists injected the runners with a substance that blocked the production of adrenaline and gave sedentary animals large doses of added adrenaline. What they now found was that when running mice could not produce adrenaline, they developed cancer at the same rate as the sedentary animals, while the sedentary animals that had been injected with extra adrenaline fought off their tumors better than other sitting mice. More remarkably, the scientists determined that adrenaline seemed to be sending biochemical signals to some of the animals' IL-6 cells, making them physiologically more alert, so that when a tumor began to develop in the affected animal, those IL-6 cells in turn activated the natural killer cells in the bloodstream and actually directed them to the tumors, like minute guide fish. With these results, ""we show that voluntary wheel running in mice can reduce the growth of tumors, and we have identified an exercise-dependent mobilization of natural killer cells as the underlying cause of this protection,"" said Pernille Hojman, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen who oversaw the new study. It perhaps provides one more incentive for us to get up and move. In the follow-up experiments, the scientists found   _  .",the hormone adrenaline has much higher levels in the blood of the exercising animals,"how these elements in the runners -- their increased adrenaline, IL-6, and natural killer immune cells fight against tumor","interleukin-6 can both increase and decrease inflammation in the body, depending on where and how it goes to work",what happens inside mice at high risk for the disease,B
282,"Plants have family values, too; it seems, with new research suggesting they can recognize close relatives in order to work together. An ability to tell family from strangers is well known in animals, allowing them to cooperate and share resources, but plants may possess similar social skills, scientists believe. Susan Dudley and Amanda File of McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, report they have demonstrated for the first time that plants can recognize their kin. This suggests that plants, though lacking recognition and memory, are capable of complex social interactions. ""Plants have this kind of hidden but complicated social life,"" Dudley said. The study found plants from the same species of beach-dwelling wildflower grew aggressively alongside unrelated neighbors but were less competitive when they shared soil with their families. Sea rocket, a North American species, showed stronger and healthier root growth when planted in pots with strangers than when raised with relatives from the same maternal  family, the study found. This is an example of kin selection, a behavior common in animals in which closely related individuals take a group approach to succeeding in their environment, the researchers said. Kin selection also applies to competition, because if family members compete less with each other, the group will do better overall. ""Everywhere you look, plants are growing right up next to other plants,"" Dudley said,"" Usually it's a case of each plant for itself. But sometimes those plants are related, and there are benefits to not wasting resources on being competitive, and there is not really a cost to not being competitive as long as your neighbor is also not being competitive."" Learning and memory appear to be important for kin recognition in animals, but this isn't an option for plants, she noted. Some researchers speculate  that plants communicate through their roots, identifying themselves using tiny chemical signatures specific to each plant's family. From the passage,we learn that   _  .",sea rocket is a South American species,sea rocket grows aggressively alongside unrelated neighbors,sea rocket grows aggressively alongside its siblings,sea rocket is a kind of bush without flowers,B

287,"My Best Enemy Once again, I was in a new school. So was a girl in my class named Lisa. That's where the similarities ended. I was tall and she was small. My thick black hair had been recently cut short into an untidy style. Her natural blonde hair flowed to her waist and looked great. I was 12 and one of the oldest in the class while she was 11 and the youngest. I was awkward and shy. She wasn't. I couldn't stand her, considering her my enemy. But she liked me and wanted to be friends. One day, she invited me over and I said yes--I was too shocked to answer any other way. My family had moved six times in six years, and I had never managed to develop any friendships. But this girl who wore the latest fashions wanted me to go home with her after school. She lived in a fun part of town that had two pizza places, an all-night bookstore, a movie theater and a park. As we walked from the school bus stop through her neighborhood, I tried to guess which house might be hers. Was it the white one with the perfect lawn or the three-story house with a front porch? I got very surprised when she led me into an old apartment building. She lived on the fourth floor in a two-room place with her mother,her stepfather, her two brothers and her sister. When we got into the room she shared with her sister, she took out a big case of Babies, which was my next surprise. I had never played with them. We sat on the floor,laughing as we made up crazy stories about the Babies. We found out that we both wanted to be writers when we were older and both had wild imaginations. We had a great day that afternoon. Lisa was loved by the whole neighborhood. The bookstore owners lent her fashion magazines; the movie theater gave her free tickets... Soon I was included in her magic world. We slept over at each other's houses and spent every free moment together.

289,"Can we turn negative thoughts like ""I never do anything right"" into positive ones like ""I can succeed""? Is there power in positive thinking? Researchers in Canada just published a study in the journal Psychological Science that says trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect: it can simply emphasize how unhappy they are. The study's authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by referring to older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better.If you tell your friend that he may be an Einstein, _ In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write passages opposing funding for the disabled.When they were later praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written. In this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students' self-esteem .The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes.Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell.When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, ""I am lovable."" Those with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the experiment.In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren't urged to think positive thoughts. The paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy  that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them.In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse.Meditation  techniques, on the contrary, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a large, more realistic perspective .Call it the power of negative thinking.

290,"For six hours we shot through the landscape of the Karoo desert in South Africa. Just rocks and sand and baking sun. Knowing our journey was ending, Daniel and I just wanted to remember all we had seen and done. He used a camera. I used words. I had already finished three notebooks and was into the fourth, a beautiful leather notebook I'd bought in a market in Mozambique. Southern Africa was full of stories. And visions. We were almost drunk on sensations. The roaring of the water at Victoria Falls, the impossible silence of the Okavango Delta in Botswana . And then the other things: dogs in the streets, whole families in Soweto living in one room, a kilometre from clean water. As we drove towards the setting sun, a quietness fell over us. The road was empty -- we  hadn't seen another car for hours. And as I drove, something caught my eye, something moving   next to me. I glanced in the mirror of the car; I glanced sideways to the right, and that was when I saw them. Next to us, by the side of the road, thirty, forty wild horses were racing the car, a cloud of dust rising behind them -- brown, muscular horses almost close enough to touch them, to   smell their hot breath. I didn't know how long they had been there next to us. I shouted to Dan: ""Look!"", but he was in a deep sleep, his camera lying useless by his feet.   They raced the car for a few seconds, then disappeared far behind us, a memory of heroic forms   in the red landscape. When Daniel woke up an hour later I told him what had happened.

In order to clear the mind, unwanted items must be thrown away to free your ""inner world"", she said. Ms Morris, who claims to have coached celebrities to major business figures, said:""Clearing clutter from your desk has the power to transform your business. "" How? Because clutter in your outer environment is the physical sign of all the clutter going on inside of you. "" Clearing clutter has a chain effect across your entire life, including your work. Having an untidy desk covered in clutter could be stopping you achieving the business success you want. "" She is sure cleaning up will be helpful even though some of history's biggest achievers lived and worked in messy conditions. Churchill was considered untidy from a boy throughout his life, from his office to his artist's studio,and the lab where Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin was famously untidy. Among the recommendations is that simply tidying a desk at work and an overflowing filing cabinet  will instantly have a positive impact on ""your inner world. "" Anything that is no longer used should not be put into storage but thrown away completely. Keeping something in the loft, garage or other part of the house, does not help because it is still connected to the person ""by tiny energetic li.nes"", Ms Morris. claims. She said, ""The things in your life that are useful to you, that add value to your life, that serve a current purpose are charged with positive energy that refreshes you and enriches your life.

First, greenhouse effect   is a very important reason for the change of the earth. People give out too much energy into the air every year. It makes the earth warmer. Climate   change is another important reason. Sometimes it becomes too hot and sometimes too cold. Sometimes there is too much rain and sometimes too little. The change of the climate makes the earth warmer. In turn, the warmth of the earth changes the climate, too. When the earth becomes warmer, there may be more rain and a rise in sea level.

Or even get ones that run on sunlight! You can also help. Let's try one of these top ideas: (1) Try to use less electricity. Turn off lights, your television, and your computer when you've stopped using them. To make electricity, fossil fuels are burned in big factories. But burning fossil fuels also makes greenhouse gases. You should also try to watch less TV. (2) Plant trees. Not only is it a fun thing to do, but it is also a great way to lower the number of greenhouse gases in the air. Trees take carbon dioxide out of the air when they grow. (3) Don't throw away your rubbish, try to recycle it. If rubbish is not recycled, it is put in the ground.

303,"An eight-year-old Arthur Gonzaga from Minas Gerais, Brazil has taken the Internet by a storm, as first reported by TheHuffingtonPost, with his online YouTube series videos ""Arthur Gourmand"". And while it would not be a far stretch of the imagination to assume an 8-year-old's cooking show would be filled with dishes like pizza and burgers, Arthur's show actually features recipes like fruit salad a la creme de passion fruit and filet mignon  . The idea to record Arthur's cooking adventures on YouTube was rooted in the young chef's leukemia diagnosis   in August 2013.Treatment and recovery for the cancer left the young boy in the hospital for the second half of the year and Aruthur was even forced to spend Christmas Eve in the emergency room of So Paulo's A.C. Camargo Cancer Center. That's when his family--father Renato Gonzaga and stepmother Priscila Inserra--decided that Arthur should create something positive that would distract him from his health. The videos, which are filmed in the kitchen of a friend of the family, are in Portuguese. They show Arthur walking the viewers through a step-by-step process of the entire recipe--from preparation to cooking. Occasionally, viewers can see Arthur's father serving as his son's _ , passing ingredients and following his lead. Fluent in Portuguese or not, viewers can immediately notice Arthur's optimistic and friendly personality. It is perhaps these qualities that have given the young rising Internet star almost 5,000 likes on his Facebook Fan Page. There are currently three videos on YouTube and according to his most recent Facebook post, the young boy will be taking suggestions for his next video. Fortunately, according to what Inserra told TheHuffingtonPost, Arthur is responding well to his treatments and is on his path to recovery. ""The secret of life is to let it take you, to have fun and to know how to turn lemons into lemonade  ,"" wrote her family, fittingly, on their most recent Facebook post. Hats off to Arthur, who truly serves as a shining example of how to turn lemons into lemonade.

304,"Classes resumed   Thursday for the students of a school in Newtown, Conn, where a gunman last month killed 20 children and 6 adults in the second-largest school shooting in U.S. history. With their school still being treated as a crime scene, more than 400 students of Sandy Hook Primary School attended classes in neighbouring Monroe. Returning students, teachers and administrators were met by a large police presence outside their new school. Several officers guarded the entrance and checked IDs of parents dropping off children. Law-enforcement officers guarding the new school called it ""the safest school in America."" Students found the same chairs and desks, when possible. Their classroom walls were painted the same colours and hung with the same pictures. Other details, such as the location of bookshelves and cubby holes, were replicated   as much as possible. The school district said parents who wanted to be close to their children were welcome to visit and stay in classrooms or an auditorium. Newtown superintendent Janet Robinson said officials would do their best to make the students feel at ease. ""We will be doing a normal day."" She said.

Credit rating agencies downgraded A.I.G because of concerns it could not honor its contracts. Unable to get new loans, A.I.G asked for government help The Federal Reserve agreed to loan A .I.G. eighty-five billion dollars in return for eighty percent of the company but it was not enough. By November, the government had extended a total of about one hundred fiftv billion doliars in aid to A .I.G--the most to any single company during the crisis. As banks refused to lend, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson proposed a plan to loosen credit markets by buylng risky assets. Congress approved the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of Two.

The Treasury moved to invest two handred fifty billion dollars directly in banks to help them lend money again. Lack of credit not only hurt banks but manufacturers, too. Falling car sales threatened America's carmakers The big three automakers--General Motors, Ford and Chrysler--told Congress that they needed loans or they faced bankmptcy.

308,"School Counseling  In our grandparents' time, it was unthinkable.In our parents' time, it was unusual and nobody spoke openly about counseling.These days, more and more schools are asking for this service and it is considered a necessity for most.Why is it? What has changed in the last fifty years to have made counseling at schools so important? ""One reason is that we expect schools to do more to protect their pupils than we did in the past,"" says school counselor, Mike Hudson."" Also, our society doesn't work as well as it should.Many parents are either under pressure of work or face the economic problems of unemployment, while children are under more and more pressure to do well at school.Many pupils feel they are pushed to their limits by their parents and teachers."" Most school children face some kind of relationship problem at some stage with family members, teachers or other pupils, so.it helps to have somebody to talk to. From the pupil' s point of view, it is easier to talk to a counselor in confidence rather than a family member or teacher.This solution is less embarrassing to pupils, who are not forced to face the person that they had problems with in the first place.They can calmly talk things through without arguments. School counselors advise not only students but also their teachers and parents, and offer other services as well, such as deciding learning disabilities or assisting parents and guardians to make the correct decisions about their children' s education. Counselors can help students with problems ranging from the most serious, like a death in the family, to what an adult would consider really trivial, like an argument with a friend. In a society that is becoming more and more stressful, this service is providing children with a supportive way to express their fear and worries. Why is school counseling becoming important?",Pupils are not well protected in school.,Parents can't help their children in learning.,Parents and pupils are under too much pressure.,The relationship between parents and schools is worse.,C
309,"What are American high schools like? Well, I'm happy to tell you what I know. When I started school here, it had already been a week since the school opened. At this school, freshmen usually go on a trip for about three days at the beginning of school. Unfortunately I missed that wonderful trip, which would have been the best time to get to know my classmates. I was really sad. I wished I'd known about it earlier. Despite the disappointment, however, I gradually adapted to my new life and school. There is a space in the basement of the teaching building where students chat and meet each other. As we do not always have the same classrooms and classmates, the school wants us to get to know each other there. Students usually come to school early, sit in that space and have fun. Around the space, there are many lockers for students to leave their books in, so that students do not have to carry a heavy schoolbag everywhere. It really surprises me that we have almost no textbooks. We only have textbooks for World History and Algebra 2 and they are big and heavy, like bricks. For other classes, we only need binders   with paper in them. Without textbooks, students learn things freely and actively. For example, my humanities teacher just teaches us what is in her mind at the time. We never know what we will learn. Another difference between American schools and Chinese schools is that American schools care about students' morality more than their academic studies. For example, if you do not finish your homework, you will just be asked to do it later, but if you cheat or lie, you will get a warning or even be kicked out. I think that most students here are good at schoolwork as well, but compared to Chinese students, they can make learning a more joyful experience. I think we should take the good points from our two different kinds of education to perfect our approach to studying. Why do students go to the basement of the teaching building?",To attend class.,To share a classroom.,To have fun.,To meet teachers.,C

311,"Studies have shown that the fewer medicines a person has to take the more likely he or she will take them. Last week, a study was released about a new treatment that combines 5 medicines for heart disease in one pill. Salim Yusuf of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada was the lead investigator. He presented the findings at the American College of Cardiology Conference in Orlando, Florida. The experimental drug is known as Polycap. It contains aspirin, a drug to lower cholesterol  and three medicines to lower blood pressure. The study was carried out at 50 health centers across India. More than two thousand people between the ages of 45 and 80 took part in the study. All had at least one risk factor for heart disease. These include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes or being severely overweight. The people were divided into 9 groups of about 200 people each. One group took Polycap. The other groups took either a single drug or different combinations of the medicines in the Polycap pill. The study showed that Polycap lowered blood pressure and cholesterol without many side effects. Doctor Yusuf said the single pill, taken once a day, could reduce the average person's risk of heart disease and stroke by about half. The maker of Polycap, Cadila Pharmaceuticals of India, paid for the study. Cardiovascular diseases  of the heart and blood vessels are the number one cause of death around the world. These diseases kill more than seventeen million people every year. 80 percent of them are in low and middle income countries. Doctor Yusuf said the single pill treatment could revolutionize heart disease prevention. People would be more likely to take one pill a day than many pills. And one pill would cost less than several pills. Other heart doctors say heart disease prevention is important but not necessarily with pills. They say patients might be able to get the same results with changes in diet and exercise. Doctors say that more research on Polycap is needed. They say the drug should be tested on thousands more people, including those in different risk, age and ethnic groups. According to the passage, the following people are more likely to get Cardiovascular disease except  _  .",old people,low - income people,overweight people,diabetic people,A
312,"""Tear them apart!"" ""Kill the fool!"" ""Murder the referee !"" These are common remarks one may hear at various sporting events. At the time they are made,they may seem innocent(,) enough. But let's not kid ourselves.They have been known to influence behavior in such a way as to lead to real violence. Books have been written about the way words affect us. It has been shown that words having certain meanings may cause us to react in ways quite foreign  to what we consider to be our usual behavior. I see the term ""opponent"" as one of those words. Perhaps the time has come to delete it from sports terms. The dictionary meaning of the term ""opponent"" is ""enemy"", or ""one who opposes your interests."" Thus, when a player meets an opponent, he or she may tend to treat that opponent as an enemy. I remember an incident in a handball game when a referee refused a player's request for a time out for a glove change because he did not consider them wet enough. The player went away to rub his gloves across his wet T-shirt and then screamed, ""Are they wet enough now?"" In the heat of battle, players have been observed to throw themselves across the court without considering the effect that such a move might have on anyone in their way. I have also witnessed a player reacting to his opponent's intentional and illegal blocking by hitting him with the ball as hard as he could during the course of play. Off the court, they are good friends. Does that make any sense? It certainly gives proof of a court attitude which differs from normal behavior. Therefore, I believe it is time we elevated the game to the level where it belongs, setting an example to the rest of the sporting world. Replacing the term ""opponent"" with ""associate"" could be a good way to start. The dictionary meaning of the term ""associate"" is ""friend"" or ""companion."" You may soon see and possibly feel the difference in your reaction to the term ""associate"" rather than ""opponent"". What did the handball player do when he was not allowed to change his gloves?",He refused to continue the game.,He angrily hit the referee with a ball.,He insisted that the referee was unfair.,He wet his gloves by rubbing them across his T-shirt.,D

(Photo By Henny Ray Abrams/Associated Press)   ks*5*u Associated Press-----The number of visitors to New York City fell last year for the first time since 2001, but falls in tourism elsewhere across the United States made it the most popular destination in the country for the first time in almost two decades, tourism officials said on Monday. Mayor Michael R. Bloombergpainted the 3.9 percent drop -- an estimated   45.3 million visitors -- as a victory, saying that during the recession the city had expected losing as much as 10 percent of its tourists. The city expects to recover most of the loss this year and remains on track to hit its long-standing goal of 50 million yearly visitors by 2012, the mayor said.  ""We have made our city cleaner, safer and more exciting than ever,"" Bloomberg said at a news conference at a Brooklyn restaurant. ""I do think we'll continue to see even more tourists on our streets as the economy improves, and I think that we'll continue to develop better than other cities.""  Though many travelers stayed home simply because money was tight, the reducing number in international visitors could result from swine flu  fears and concerns over border security measures, Bloomberg said.  Still, the Statue of Liberty, which reopened its crown to tourists, reported a jump in the number of visitors. So did other New York City attractions. And the city's entertainment and hotel industry -- which provides one-tenth of the city's private jobs -- actually grew in 2009.  ""The lodging industry  really is using discounting to motivate demand,"" he said, adding that the price drops have importantly _ ""the city's ability to keep the level of tourism that it's had.""

316,"No one likes to make mistakes. But a new study says organizations learn more from their failures than from their successes, and keep that knowledge longer. One of the researchers was Vinit Desai, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. He worked with Peter Madsen from the Marriott School of Management at Brigham Young University in Utah. They did not find much long-term ""organizational learning"" from success. It is possible, they say. But Professor Desai says they found that knowledge gained from failure lasts for years. He says organizations should treat failures as a learning opportunity and not try to ignore them. The study looked at companies and organizations that launch satellites--and other space vehicles. Professor Desai compared two shuttle flights. In two thousand two, a piece of insulating  material broke off during launch and damaged a rocket on the Atlantis. Still, the flight was considered a success. Then, in early two thousand three, a piece of insulation struck the Columbia during launch. This time, the shuttle broke apart on re-entry and the seven crew members died. NASA officials suspended all flights and an investigation led to suggested changes. Professor Desai says the search for solutions after a failure can make leaders more open-minded. He points to airlines as an example of an industry that has learned from failures in the past. He advises organizations to look for useful information in small failures and failures they avoided. He also urges leaders to encourage the open sharing of information. The study appeared in the Academy of Management Journal. The mistakes we learn from do not have to be our own. We recently asked people on our Facebook page to tell us a time they had done something really silly.

317,"It is often said that you cannot ""teach an old dog new tricks"", but three New Zealand dogs have decided to prove otherwise by learning a skill --- driving a car! What's even more impressive is that the three who have become skilled in just eight weeks are not special dogs that belong to some rich owners, but abandoned ones at New Zealand's SPCA. To get their training started, 10-month old Porter, 18-month-old Monty and one-year-old Ginny were selected from a pool of seven potential candidates and moved to Animal Q, a talent agency that teaches animals tricks for movies and television shows. The driving classes began with teaching the dogs some basic driving techniques like turning the steering wheels and applying the brakes. After that the dogs practiced everything they had learnt behind the wheels of a motorized car. Then finally, it was time for the big test--- driving a real car! Human cars are not really built for four-legged animals, so the car they drove was adjusted so that the dogs could sit comfortably and easily reach the steering wheel with their paws. Though they all seemed to do very well, the real test came on Monday night when Monty, the best driver of the three, showed his great driving skill on live television. Why would the SPCA go through so much trouble to highlight the skills of homeless dogs?  The reason is to show that adopting a dog from a shelter does not mean owners are getting a pet that is worse than one purchased from a keeper. The CEO of the SPCA is hoping that this unusual event will be enough to convince the residents of New Zealand to consider them, when searching for a pet. We surely hope so, meanwhile we are almost certain that these three pioneers have at least landed their names in the Guinness World Records, creating a category that probably does not even exist today!

320,"Why can some people sleep through noises like a honking car or flushing toilet, while others are awakened by the lightest sound? To find the answer, sleep researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital conducted an unusual study of 12 self-described deep sleepers. After tests confirmed that the healthy volunteers were solid sleepers, they took part in a three-night study in the university's sleep laboratory. The participants spent the night in a big and comfortable room. But the room also included four speakers positioned near the top of the bed. During the night, the deep sleepers were subjected to 14 different recorded sounds, like street traffic, toilets flushing, an ice machine dispensing and an airplane flying overhead. Next door, the researchers monitored their sleep patterns and brain waves. As expected, all of the participants slept  ly well, but there were differences in how they responded to the noisy interruptions. Some of the sleepers didn't wake up even when a sound was blasted at 70 decibels  ; others were awakened by sounds at 40 or 50 decibels. The researchers discovered that the difference in a sleeper's reaction to noise could be predicted by the level of brain activity called ""sleep spindles''. A sleep spindle is a burst of high-frequency brain activity coming from deep inside the brain during sleep. The source of the spindles is the thalamus, a part of the brain that sends sensory information to the rest of the cortex  . Before the study, the Massachusetts researchers theorized   that the spindles are the brain's way of preventing sensory information from passing through the thalamus and waking the rest of the brain during sleep. They found that the sleepers who experienced the most sleep spindles during the night were also the soundest sleepers and were least likely to be awakened by noise. Scientists already know that most people become lighter sleepers with age, most likely because older people experience less ""slow wave sleep'', which is the deepest stage of sleep. People also produce fewer sleep spindles as they age. But even when controlling for the stage of sleep a person was in, the number of sleep spindles still predicted their risk for awakening because of noise. More research is needed, but the findings suggest that a better understanding of sleep spindles could lead to new behavioral or drug therapies for people with sleep disorders. For instance, future studies may try to determine whether diet, exercise or other behaviors may influence the number of sleep spindles a person produces during the night. It can be learned from the passage that   _  .","the older a deep sleeper becomes, the lighter his sleep must be","the more ""slow wave sleep"" one experiences, the deeper sleep one has","the more frequently a sleeper's brain works, the less information it sends","the deeper sleep people have, the more likely they will be awakened by noise",B

However,there are also plenty of things that astronauts can't do because of their weightless environment, and that's very sad. What's worse, they can't even let their sadness show--because it's impossible to cry in zero gravity. Of course, astronauts can still produce tears. But crying is much more difficult in space,reported The Atlantic in January. Without gravity, tears don't flow downward out of the eyes like they do here on Earth. This means that when you cry in space, your tears have nowhere to go--they just stick to your eyes. In May 2011, astronaut Andrew Feustel experienced this during one of his spacewalks.""Tears,"" he said, ""don't fall off your eye... They just kind of stay there."" Besides making your vision unclear, this can also cause physical pain. Back on Earth, tears are supposed to bring comfort to the eyes.But that's not the case in space.The space environment dries out astronauts' eyes, and when tears suddenly wet the eyes, it can cause pain rather than comfort. ""My right eye is painful like crazy."" Feustel told his teammate during the walk. Since gravity doesn't work in space, astronauts need some extra help to get rid of the tears.Feustel chose to rub his eyes against his helmet to wipe the tears away. Another choice is to just wait--""When the tears get big enough they simply break free of the eye and float around,""astronaut Ron Parise told The Atlantic. There are lots of small things--things like crying--that we are so used to on Earth. We usually take them for granted, until they become a problem in a totally different environment,like space. There, astronauts can't talk to each other directly. They also can't eat or drink in normal ways. They can't even burp , because there is no gravity to hold the food down in their stomach. If they do burp, they just end up throwing up  everything in their stomach,according to the UK National Space Center. Thus, perhaps it's only space explorers who can honestly say:""Gravity, you're the best."" What can the astronaut do to get rid of the tears?",Rub his eyes against his helmet to let the tears float forward.,Rub his eyes by hand to let the tears float around.,Get the tears big enough to fall off of his eyes.,Get the tears big enough to break away from his eyes.,D

326,"The works of Shakespeare and Wordsworth are ""rocket-boosters"" to the brain and better therapy than self-help books, researchers will say this week. Scientists, psychologists and English academics at Liverpool University have found that reading the works of the Bard and other classical writers has a beneficial effect on the mind, catches the reader's attention and cause moments of self-reflection. Using scanners, they monitored the brain activity of volunteers as they read works by William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, T.S Eliot and others. They then ""translated"" the texts into more ""straightforward"", modern language and again monitored the readers' brains as they read the words. Scans showed that the more ""challenging"" prose  and poetry set off far more electrical activity in the brain than the more pedestrian versions. Scientists were able to study the brain activity as it responded to each word and record how it ""lit up"" as the readers encountered unusual words, surprising phrases or difficult sentence structure. This ""lighting up"" of the mind lasts longer than the initial electrical spark, shifting the brain to a higher gear, encouraging further reading. The research also found that reading poetry, in particular, increases activity in the right hemisphere  of the brain, an area concerned with ""autobiographical memory"", helping the reader to reflect on and reappraise their own experiences in light of what they have read. The academics said this meant the classics were more useful than self-help books. Philip Davis, an English professor who has worked on the study with the university's magnetic resonance centre, will tell a conference this week: ""Serious literature acts like a rocket-booster to the brain. ""The research shows the power of literature to shift mental pathways, to create new thoughts, shapes and connections in the young and the elderly alike.""

327,"When children learn a language, they learn the grammar as well as words or vocabulary. No one teaches them; children just "" _ "". Before babies begin to produce words, they produce sounds. Some of these sounds will remain if they occur in the language being learned, and others will disappear. This is called the ""babbling stage"". A child does not learn the language ""all at once"". The child first speaks only one-word ""sentences"". After a few months, the two-word stage arises. During this stage, the child puts two words together. These two-word sentences have definite patterns and express grammatical and meaningful relationships. Still later, in the telegraphic stage, the child will produce longer sentences. These longer sentences are mainly made up of content words. The child's early grammar lacks many of the rules of the adult grammar, but gradually it will become perfect.

I have even seen a person attempting to speak on her cell phone while ordering ice cream at Dairy Queen, thus speaking to two people at once. As the over-spending of technology increases, people begin to take less joy in the simple pleasures of life--joys that don't cost money--from observing clouds, playing with children to thinking or reading. And it is not just telephones that take the responsibility; too much value is placed on items   from computers to cars. Many things are purchased   merely  to show off. Do you really need a cell phone that plays games, shows movies and takes pictures? No, cell phones should be purchased to use in urgent situations.You do not need to use your telephone when you are at someone else's house or in a restaurant. Technology and possessions   do not bring joy. While some technology is necessary, it can get ridiculous . Each possession just makes us want more, while simple pleasures can be enjoyed now and then. Instead of spending our time buying a third television or looking into the newest cell phone models, we should be acting more productively to improve the world by volunteering, for example. Or, we should reconsider playing computer games or taking pictures on our cell phones and read a book or imagine what shapes the clouds are in the sky instead.

330,"Do you know why different animals or pests have their special colours? Colours in them seem to be used mainly to protect themselves. Some birds like eating locusts. but birds cannot easily catch them. Why? It is because locusts change their colours together with the change of the colours of crops. When crops are green, locusts look green. But as the harvest time comes, locusts change to the same brown colour as crops have. Some other pests with different colours from plants are easily found and eaten by others. So they have to hide themselves for lives and appear only at night. If you study the animal life, you'll find the main use of colouring is protecting themselves. Bears, lions and other animals move quietly through forests. They cannot be seen by hunters. This is because they have the colours much like the tree. Have you ever noticed an even more strange act? A kind of fish in the sea can send out a kind of very black liquid when it faces danger. While the liquid spread over, the enemies cannot find it. And it immediately swims away. So it has lived up to now though it isn't strong at all.

332,"Height is just one of the thousands of features your genes decide. In fact, because you have two parents, your genes provide you a height that usually lands somewhere between the height of each parent. If both your parents are tall, then most probably you will be tall, too, but if you have questions about how tall you're going to be, ask your doctor if he or she can help you find it out. But genes don't decide everything. For example, eating an unhealthy diet can keep you from growing to your ideal height. Getting plenty of sleep and enough exercise will help you grow to the expected height. No doubt you're wondering how fast you should grow. It depends. There's no perfect or right answer. Generally speaking, kids grow about 2 inches (6 centimeters) a year between age 3 and the time when they start puberty (when your body starts changing and becoming more grown up). Your doctor will know how your growth has been going over the years. Two centimeters here and 2 inches there are not nearly as important as the height you're at now, how you've been growing up to this point, and what other changes your body may be going through. Don't be scared if you seem to have grown a lot in a very short time. Everyone has a growth spurt  during puberty. The age for starting puberty is about 10 for girls and about 11 for boys. But it can be earlier or later ---between 7 and 13 for girls and 9 and 15 for boys. You'll usually begin to notice that you're growing faster about a year or so after your body starts to show the first changes of puberty.

333,"Imagine putting some bacteria in the freezer and taking them out millions of years later to find that they are still alive. That would be similar to what happened recently, when scientists brought eight-million-year-old bacteria back to life -- simply by thawing them out. The ancient bacteria were found frozen in the world's oldest known tracts of ice, the glaciers   of Antarctica. Professor Bidle and his colleagues found and revived   two samples of bacteria from the glacial ice. The first was a hundred thousand years old, and the second was around eight million years old. The eight-million-year-old bacteria were alive. But their genes were seriously damaged from long exposure to cosmic ( ) radiation, which is higher at the earth's poles. Most of the bacteria in the samples probably blew over from African deserts, said Paul Falkowski, a scientist at prefix = st1 /RutgersUniversity. Once the bacteria landed on the glacier's snowy surface, they combined with the snow to form ice. ""These ices are actually gene banks,"" he added. As glaciers and ice caps melt as a result of increasing global warming, large amounts of bacterial genetic material might be washed into the ocean. These bacteria might get incorporated into today's bacteria in the ocean, or living bacteria from the ice might also grow and have an important effect on the ecosystem. ""How that's going to play out, we don't know,"" Bidle said. He and Falkowski plan to focus their future work on how current ice melting influences modem bacteria's genetic diversity.

335,"""Hypotheses ,"" said Medawarin 1964, ""are imaginative and inspirational in character""; they are ""adventures of the mind"". He was arguing in favour of the position taken by Karl Popper that the nature of scientific method is hypothetico-deductive and not, as is generally believed, inductive. The myth  of scientific method is that it is inductive: that the formulation of scientific theory starts with the basic, raw evidence of the senses -- simple, fair, unprejudiced observation. Out of these sensory data -- commonly referred to as ""facts"" -- generalisations   will form. The myth is that from a disorderly collection of factual information an orderly, relevant theory will somehow come out. However, the starting point of induction is an impossible one. There is no such thing as an unprejudiced observation. Every act of observation we make is a function of what we have seen or otherwise experienced in the past. All scientific work of an experimental or exploratory nature starts with some expectation about the outcome. This expectation is a hypothesis. Hypotheses provide the motivation for the inquiry and influence the method. It is in the light of an expectation that some observations are held to be relevant and some irrelevant, that one method is chosen and others abandoned, that some experiments are conducted and others are not. Hypotheses arise by guesswork, or by inspiration, but having been started they can and must be tested thoroughly, using the appropriate method. If the predictions you make as a result of deducing certain consequences from your hypothesis are not shown to be correct then you abandon or adjust your hypothesis. If the predictions turn out to be correct then your hypothesis has been supported and may be kept until such time as some further test shows it not to be correct. Once you have arrived at your hypothesis, which is a product of your imagination, you then move on to a strictly logical and thorough process, based upon deductive argument -- therefore the term ""hypothetico-deductive"". So don't worry if you have some idea of what your results will tell you before you even begin to collect data; there are no scientists in existence who really wait until they have all the evidence in front of them before they try to work out what it might possibly mean. The hypothetico-deductive method describes the logical approach to much research work, but it does not describe the psychological behaviour that brings it about. The psychological behaviour is a much more complicated process -- involving guesses, reworkings, corrections, and above all inspiration, in the deductive as well as the hypothetic component. However, describing the logical approach is like writing the final thesis  or published papers of research work. These theses and papers have been, quite properly, organised into a more logical order so that the worth of the output may be evaluated independently of the behavioural processes by which it was obtained. It is the difference, for example between the academic papers with which Crick and Watson demonstrated the structure of the DNA molecule  and the fascinating book The Double Helix in which Watson (1968) described how they did it. From this point of view, the scientific method may more usefully be thought of as a way of writing up research rather than as a way of carrying it out. According to the author, a good scientific research is a process  _  .",starting from details and ending in generalisations,where observations play more role than expectations do,where hypotheses are gradually tested before finally approved,which cannot be started before enough evidences are collected,C

337,"How Do Animals Catch their ZZZ's ? Different creatures have developed some pretty creative ways to get their rest and stay safe. The lizard likes to sleep at the far end of small branches hanging out over a pond or lake in the rain forest. If a snake tries to slither up the branch to eat it, it will shake the branch and knock the lizard off, and the lizard will fall safely into the water. Chameleons can change color to match their surroundings in order to hide even while sleeping. Gorillas like to sleep high in the trees. They build a new bed every night, sometimes taking up to half an hour to pile branches, twigs, and leaves into a comfortable bed. Birds also find it safe to sleep in the trees, but unless they have eggs or young chicks, they don't use a nest. They just lock their feet around a branch and hang on. A special tendon in their legs is automatically tight when they are at rest, so they won't let go and fall. Dolphins live underwater, but must come to the surface to breathe. Scientists now believe that dolphins may sleep with only half their brain, while the other half stays awake to keep them safe and breathing. Seals also do this, lying on their sides on the surface of the water with one flipper underwater paddling to keep their noses above the surface. Some ducks may also have this ability, and actually sleep with one eye closed and one eye open. What does the writer intend to tell us?",The cleverest animal is the gorilla because it can make beds.,Differences in habitat can lead to different living habits.,The ways animals catch their ZZZ's are pretty much the same.,In order to protect themselves most animals choose not to sleep,B

Toyota is busy working on the solution to the flaw and will release improvement methods before April 15, according to the administration. This marks Toyota's second recalling this year after the auto giant announced in January that it would recall 22,869 units of Lexus IS cars in China due to wiper arm problem. China's private auto ownership reached 93.09 million units by the end of 2012, up 18.3 percent compared with the year before. Along with the fast expanding auto market, Chinese drivers grow more concerned about the quality of their cars. Also on Saturday, the AQSIQ said in a statement on its website that its research has basically confirmed the German automaker Volkswagen's direct shift gearbox (DSG) transmission has defects which may cause engine power failures and urged Volkswagen to recall defective cars after China Central Television (CCTV) exposed Volkswagen's gearbox defect on Friday.

Scientists from Surrey University and design experts from the London College of Fashion are developing a program which can take precise   waist, hip, chest and other measurements from camera images. Using the person's height as a starting point,the software will be able to build up a 3D image and estimate their size at various different points on the body, based on their overall proportions. The result will be a more accurate sizing guide than previous systems based on waist size or a ""small/medium/large""scale, which rely on limited measurements and the buyer's perception of their own body size. Shoppers and retailers who choose to sign up for the project could save millions of pounds a year in postage costs by removing the need to order multiple sizes of the same garment  and send back ill-fitting clothes, researchers claimed. The project, sponsored by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(EPSRC), is expected to be brought to market within two years. After choosing an item, the shopper will activate the software, enter their height, stand in front of their webcam or smart phone in their underwear and take a photograph. The software will not store or transmit the image to the internet, but will use it to judge the person's dimensions at various points on their body.

345,"One of the keys to being successful is persistence .Once you have determined exactly what you want to achieve, you must take active action in order to succeed. One of the things you'll notice on your journey towards your goal are roadblocks. That is, you will come across obstacles  to discourage your progress. Actually, they are a part of life. Everyone would have every success they ever wanted if there were no obstacles. Your job is to be persistent and work through those obstacles. If you find little or no obstacles along the way, chances are that you are not really challenging yourself. And when you do reach your goal, you won't experience the feeling of ""sweet success"". Make your goal a challenging one! If you take the time to study any successful person, you will learn that the vast majority of them have had more ""failures"" than they have had ""successes"". This is because successful people are persistent; the more they stumble and fall, the more they get right back up and get going again. On the other hand, people that don't get back up and try again, never reach success. For example, Walt Disney was turned down 302 times before he got financing for his dream of creating the ""Happiest Place on Earth"". Today, due to his persistence, millions of people have shared ""the joy of Disney"". Having known these facts, keep in mind that you must constantly reevaluate your circumstances and the approach you are using to reach your goal. There is no sense in being persistent at something that you are doing incorrectly! Sometimes you have to modify your approach along the way.

346,"On Thursday October 3, Adam Harper decided to stop drinking coffee. Adam is a MBA student at Harvard University. He studies long hours, gets very little sleep and as a result, he drinks a lot of coffee---anywhere from five to six cups a day. Recently, Adam felt that drinking thus much coffee was making it hard for him to sleep at all. He also began having problems with his concentration , and complained of stomachaches. Adam's doctor made this suggestions: stop drinking coffee altogether. When Adam got up on October 3, he began his day without his morning coffee. By 11:00 a.m., Adam was in a terrible mood  . He was tired and had a headache. At 11:30, he had a meeting with his student advisor. In the meeting, he found it almost impossible to continue. What was going on? Caffeine, a chemical found in coffee, was most likely the reason for how Adam felt. Caffeine is a stimulant that boosts  energy levels and improves concentration- but only for a short time. Lowering caffeine consumption  often causes a drop in blood pressure and the result is a ""coffee headache"", People who stop drinking coffee often say they feel tired and moody, and find it hard to focus. The good news is that these feeling usually pass after four and five days. During this time, doctors suggested taking some aspirin for the headache. So, if Adam can wait, in less than a week, he may be feeling much better. What happened to Adam on Thursday October 3?",He didn't go to his study.,He complained about the student advisor.,He didn't drink any coffee at all.,He decided to stop drinking coffee.,D
347,"Bowing is a very important custom in Japan. Unlike people in many other countries, they greet each other by bowing instead of shaking hands. It is impolite not to return a bow to whoever bows to you. Bowing has many functions in one. It expresses the feeling of respect, thanks, regret, and so on. You can bow when you say, ""thank you"", ""sorry"", ""hello"", ""goodbye"", ""congratulations"", ""excuse me"", ""good morning"", and more. Bowing seems simple, but there are different ways of bowing. Bowing techniques vary from a small nod of the head to a long, 90-degree bow. It depends on the social position or age of the person you bow to. If your opposite is of higher social position or older than yourself, you are supposed to bow deeper and longer than him or her. It is polite to bow from your waist. Men usually keep their hands at their sides, and women usually put their hands together on their legs with their fingers touching. If it is not a very formal situation, you can bow by nodding. The most common bow is a bow of about 15 degrees. You might feel strange doing it, but try to bow in Japan. You will be considered very polite! How people greet in many countries?",by bowing,by shaking hands,by kissing each other,by touching,B

349,"From the health point of view we are living in a marvelous age. We are immunized   from birth against many of the most dangerous diseases. A large number of once fatal illnesses can now be cured by modern drugs and surgery. It is almost certain hat one day remedies will be found for the most stubborn remaining diseases. The expectation of life has increased enormously. But though the possibility of living a long and happy life is greater than ever before, every day we witness the incredible slaughter of men, women and children on the roads. Man versus the motorcar! It is a never-ending battle which man is losing. Thousands of people the world over are killed or horribly killed each year and we are quietly sitting back and letting it happen. It has been rightly said that when a man is sitting behind a steering wheel, his car becomes the extension of his personality. There is no doubt that the motorcar often brings out a man's very worst qualities. People who are normally quiet and pleasant may become unrecognizable when they are behind a steering-wheel. They are ill-mannered and aggressive, willful as two-years-olds and utterly selfish. All their hidden frustrations, disappointments and jealousies seem to be brought to the surface by the act of driving. The surprising thing is that society smiles so kindly on the motorist and seems to forgive his behavior. Everything is done for his convenience. Cities are allowed to become almost uninhabitable because of heavy tragic; towns are made ugly by huge car parks; the countryside is desecrated   by road networks; and the mass annual slaughter becomes nothing more than a statistic, to be conveniently forgotten. It is high time a world code were created to reduce this senseless waste of human life. With regard to driving, the laws of some countries are notoriously lax and even the strictest are not strict enough. A code which was universally accepted could only have a dramatically beneficial effect on the accident rate. Here are a few examples of some of the things that might be done. The driving test should be standardized and made far more difficult than it is; all the drivers should be made to take a test every three years or so, the age at which young people are allowed to drive any vehicle should be raised to at least 21; all vehicles should be put through strict annual tests for safety. Even the smallest amount of alcohol in the blood can weaken a person's driving ability. Present drinking and drinking laws (where they exist) should be made much stricter. Maximum and minimum speed limits should be enforced on all roads. Governments should lay down safety specifications for manufacturers. All advertising stressing power and performance should be banned. These measures may sound extremely harsh. But surely nothing should be considered as too severe if it results in reducing the annual loss of human life. After all, the world is for human being, not motorcars. The main idea of this passage is that   _   .",traffic accidents are mainly caused by motorists.,thousands of people the world over are killed each year.,the laws of some countries about driving are too lax.,only stricter traffic laws can prevent accidents.,D

Johnny wandered out, crossed some fields, and two hours later, and arrived in the next village. He was just able to give his name and address. By the time he was seven, Johnny used to vanish from home two to three times a year. Sometimes he covered quite long distances on foot. On other occasions he got on a bus or even a train, and simply sat there until someone asked for his ticket. Generally the police brought him home. ""Why do you do it?"" they used to ask. ""You aren't unhappy at home, are you? .... """"Of course not,"" Johnny replied."" Then why?"" ""I just like seeing places,"" Johnny told them. Johnny continued to ""see places"" although everyone tried to stop him. His parents used to watch him closely, and so did his teachers; but sooner or later Johnny managed to slip away. As he grew older, his favorite trick was to hide on a long distance truck. Sometimes he used to travel hundreds of miles before anyone discovered him. It is hardly surprising that eventually Johnny managed to get on board a plane. He was twelve at the time. It was a cargo plane and, a few hours later, Johnny found himself in Cairo. How did he get on board? No one knows! According to Johnny himself, it was easy: he just went into the airport, walked along some corridors and got on board the nearest plane. In spite of all this, Johnny did well at school. He enjoyed maths and languages and, perhaps not surprisingly, he was especially good at geography. ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" his teachers asked him. Johnny did not take long to answer that question. ""An explorer!"" he answered.

356,"Happiness pays off, studies show. Psychologists seeking the real secrets of happiness report that very happy people tend to be more _ and agreeable than less happy people. ""Our findings suggest that very happy people have rich and satisfying social relationships and spend little time alone compared to average people,"" write psychologists Ed Diener and Martin E. P. Seligman in the journal Psychological Science. Solid social relationships do not promise happiness, but they are an important contributing factor. The very happy people whom the authors studied all said they had good quality social relationships. However, the authors write, there is no single key to high happiness. ""High happiness seems to be like beautiful symphonic music--including many instruments, without any one being enough for the beautiful quality."" Diener regards happiness as ""subjective   wellbeing""--in other words, the person evaluates his or her own quality of life. The question to ask is, ""Is my life going well, according to the standards I choose to use?"" If the answer is ""yes"", then that person is judged to be happy. Because people evaluate their lives based on happiness, subjective wellbeing is very important. Though necessary, it is not enough for having a good life. ""Subjective wellbeing seems quite necessary for the 'good society', although it is not enough for that society because there are other things we also value and would want in such a place."" says Diener. Can subjective wellbeing be measured scientificall? Diener points out three parts contributing to happiness: pleasant emotions and moods, lack of negative emotions and moods, and satisfaction judgment, to which other factors including cheerfulness and feelings of fulfillment may be added. There is no magic formula for happiness. Diener suggests steps you can take to ensure you are as happy as you can be. Surrounding yourself with good friends and family--people who care about you and whom you care about--is a start. Joining in activities you enjoy and value is also important; whether it's work or play, keeping busy in an environment enjoyable to you will contribute much to your subjective wellbeing.

But instead of blaming students for their behavior, we should say noto too much homework. This is important because by using mobile phone applications to do theirhomework, students don't add much to their knowledge, says an article in Guangzhou-based YangchengEvening News. Excerpts  : Using mobile phone applications to do homework is no different from copying from someone else'swork. This is the opinion of a vast majority of teachers. Students who seek cell phone apps help to do theirhomework will pay dearly during major exams when they cannot seek the help of such applications, theteachers say. The heavy load of homework Chinese students are burdened with, said to be the heaviest in the world,has led to the popularity of these applications. Senior high school students in China rarely go to bed before 11 pm. A report in Shanghai published in2013 showed that students in the city on average spend 28.2 hours in class every week, the 9th highestamong 65 countries and regions surveyed. Also, they spend an average of 13.8 hours a week doinghomework, most in the world. There is no association between the amount of homework one does and the amount of knowledge onegathers. In fact, a research by Australian experts shows that the result is exactly the opposite: the morehours students spend doing homework, the less effective they will be in gaining knowledge. The United States is one of the countries where students do little homework, but that has not damagedthe country's academic status in the world.

358,"""Image is everything."" An entire industry has been built upon the concept that image is everything, but an appealing image isn't enough when there's no substance behind it. First of all, one should consider how important image is in selling products and services. Advertising agencies have raised the art of creating an image to a state of near perfection. But if the product or service doesn't live up to it, customers will be very dissatisfied. The recent scandal   about the Arthur Andersen accounting firm showed that behind that image, it had unfair business practices under the table. Despite the previous positive image, the firm is being accused of criminal actions. Although the image had been nearly perfect, the reality behind the image has led to its downfall. Similarly, personal consultants  can build up a very positive public image for politicians and movie stars in the view of the general commons. But once again, history is filled with examples of both that fell from grace   like the story of the Hollywood actor giving in to the pressures of fame and fortune. With people, just as with products and services, image is certainly important, but without positive substance behind it, failure is close. To conclude, it's clear that an appealing image is extremely important to success, whether that image is related to selling a product or service or to the ""selling"" of a person. But image is only half of the equation . What lies behind that image is every bit as important as the image itself -- the person or product must live up to that image or there's little chance for long-term success.

China is among the three countries in the world that carry out agricultural research in space. The others are Russia and the US. Since 1987, China has sent about 1,000 species of seeds into space. These include green peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers  , carrots, lettuce and wheat. Even on China's first manned spacecraft Shenzhou-V, there were some seeds from Taiwan. ""Conditions in outer space such as radiation and low gravity can cause big changes in the seeds,"" said Chinese researcher Jin Xing. But not all seeds are better after going to space. After returning to Earth, the best seeds are selected.These seeds produce much more and also grow faster than normal seeds. As the safety of genetically modified   food is still being debated, some people doubt the safety of these ""space vegetables"" because some of their genes are changed during the trip to space. But Jin holds a more positive view. He said, ""unlike genetically modified crops, no new genes are introduced to the space vegetables, so they are definitely safe."" China has also been co-operating with NASA to grow some super size potatoes on the International Space Station. Special growth rooms use computers to control the light, temperature and humidity  .

There she studied the skills of the masters in Rome, Seville, Antwerp, and Paris.

361,"Scientists have long understood the key role that oceans play in regulating the Earth's climate. Oceans cover 70 percent of the globe and store a thousand times more heat than the atmosphere does. What's newer is the understanding of how this key component of our climate system responds to global warming. A brake on global warming -- for now One of oceans'most important climate functions is absorbing heat and carbon dioxide (CO2), one of the gases that cause global warming. Acting as a heat sponge  , oceans have absorbed huge amounts of heat and CO2in the last forty years. Fujita explains that ""oceans are saving us from faster climate change -- they are a big flywheel that delays rapid overheating of the Earth, putting a brake on the climate system."" ""That's the good news,"" he adds. ""The bad news is that oceans only slow the atmospheric warming. Once oceans come to balance with a greenhouse gas warmed earth, the extreme heat will remain in the atmosphere and things will get much hotter."" But where and how oceans release this accumulated   heat is uncertain. And as oceans store heat, fragile underwater ecosystems are struggling. The most recent scientific report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also notes with concern that oceans are acidifying because of increased absorption of atmospheric CO2, and thus causing a threat for shell-forming species. Sharp increases in carbon dioxide levels will cause further acidification of oceans. Currents distributing heat Another important role oceans play is that of distributor. Oceans deliver heat and life-sustaining nutrients around the globe. Just as blood vessels bring oxygen and nutrients to cells in the human body, oceans' currents carry oxygen, nutrients and heat throughout the Earth. Oceans distribute 25 percent to 50 percent of the energy the planet receives from the sun. For example, the Gulf Stream carries heat across the Atlantic. This warm current gives northwestern Europe a milder climate than it would normally have so far north. A change to oceans' circulation   patterns could throw Europe into a colder period, even as the rest of world experiences warmer temperatures. From the passage we can learn that oceans' currents  _  .",produce oxygen and nutrients everywhere,absorb 25% to 50% of the energy from the sun,distribute heat and nutrients around the globe,change oceans' circulation patterns,C

In many parts of the state, beavers  are pests and need to be controlled. The 10-to-12-year-old girls found out where beavers lived, set traps, and skinned the two animals they caught. The girls hope to catch ten more beavers so that the entire troop can make mittens and hats with the fur. They also want to cook beaver meat. Troop leaders and members say the Scouts are doing a good deed by helping control the state's beaver population. But animal-rights activists say trapping is cruel. They want the Girl Scouts to stop in their tracks. Beavers aren't only causing a problem in Alaska. Residents in Sampson County, N.C., have turned to a local committee to help them battle the growing beaver population there. County landowners are frustrated after the county spent more than $ 50,000 in eight years trying to reduce the beaver population through a government program. The joint state and federal program included paying money to trappers for every beaver carcass they trapped. Many local residents say that the program didn't work because there were too few trappers. That's why the county set up its own committee to investigate other ways to control the area's beaver population. The county will rely on its own beaver-trapping program. It has hired a trapper to set traps in various areas. The county will pay $10 for every beaver carcass. Why do many people say that beavers are a nuisance? For beavers to survive, they need lots of water. Water provides the large rodent  with a place to hide from meat - eating animals. Beavers also store food underwater for the winter. When there's not enough water in a particular area, beavers get busy building dams.

364,"Some caterpillars'  warning signals may have evolved   from walking.      A team, writing in the journal Nature Communications, reported that the hair-like structures   the creatures use to make sounds evolved from legs. The team studied caterpillars which use these structures to communicate their ownership of leaves. This means the caterpillars are able to ""tell"" strangers to go away without risking injury in conflicts. ""These are really interesting caterpillars,"" said Dr. Jayne Yack from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, who led the research. ""They make signals using hair-like structures which are on their back ends."" The caterpillars drag these structures across the leaf to make scraping  sounds when strangers enter their ""leaf shelters"". ""When they make this signal, the strangers leave,"" explained Dr. Yack. ""It's like saying 'I'm here, get out of here --I already own this leaf'."" The scientists looked at other species within the same group of caterpillars and created a ""family tree"" of the creatures. They used chemical markers to work out the relationship between the animals, showing which in the group were the more ancient species and which species evolved more recently. ""Those more ancient species actually don't have these sound-producing structures. They have legs that they use to walk towards strangers,"" said Dr. Yack. These more ancient species, she explained, walk towards strangers and try to attack them. ""They can kill each other in the conflicts,"" Dr. Yack added. She said that the evolution of the scraping show had allowed the caterpillars to solve their conflicts without fighting. ""So our idea is that these signals actually avoid damage to both sides --they solve conflicts in a more 'friendly' way.""

The vessel, which had been conducting China's 30th Antarctic expedition before going to the aid of the Russian ship Akademik Shokalskiy, will now continue with its scheduled activities. The trapped Russian ship was also trying to free itself on Tuesday, with the favorable west wind loosening the surrounding ice, according to CCTV.

However, Xuelong became trapped during the rescue effort, with the ice surrounding the vessel three to four meters thick, far beyond the ship's ice-breaking capability. Qu Tanzhou, director of the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration under the State Oceanic Administration, told China Daily via telephone on Tuesday that Xuelong's attempts at the breakout started on Tuesday morning. ""A west wind is blowing on Tuesday, as we expected, which makes the floes and ice surrounding Xuelong more loose , creating favorable conditions for sailing on Wednesday,"" Qu said.

It was fun to them, as it would be to an English crowd; besides, they wanted the meat. It made me a little uneasy. I had no intention of shooting the elephant--I had merely sent for the rifle to defend myself--and it is always uneasy to have a crowd following you. I marched down the hill, looking and feeling a fool, with the rifle over my shoulder and an ever-growing army of people knocking and pushing at my heels. Beyond the huts there was a rice field a thousand yards across, muddy from the first rains. The elephant was standing eight yards from the road. He took not the slightest notice of the crowd. He was tearing up bunches of grass, beating them against his knees to clean them and feeding them into his mouth. As soon as I saw the elephant I knew with perfect certainty that I ought not to shoot him. It is a serious matter to shoot a working elephant -- it is comparable to destroying a huge and costly piece of machinery. There, peacefully eating, the elephant looked no more dangerous than a cow. I thought then and I think now that his attack of ""must"" was already passing off, in which case he would merely wander harmlessly about. Moreover, I did not in the least want to shoot him. But at that moment I glanced round at the crowd that had followed me. It was an immense crowd, two thousand at the least and growing every minute. I looked at the sea of the faces above the colorful clothes--faces all happy and excited over this bit of fun, all certain that the elephant was going to be shot. They were watching me as they would watch a magician about to perform a trick. They did not like me. But with the magical rifle in my hands I was momentarily worth watching. And suddenly I realized that I should have to shoot the elephant after all. The people expected it of me and I had got to do it; I could feel their two thousand wills pressing me forward. And it was at this moment that I first felt the hollowness, the uselessness of the white man's control in the East. Here was I, standing in front of the unarmed crowd--seemingly the leading actor; but in reality only a puppet  . I understood in this moment that when the white man turns ruler of complete power it is his own freedom that he destroys. The people were glad to think the elephant was to be shot mainly because   _  .",it had damaged their homes and crops,it would provide them with meat,it would make them feel entertained,it was spoiling their rice fields,C

A kilt is a colored skirt reaching down to the knees . It has checks   on it with different colors, like red or blue. Each family in Scotland has its own colors. How did the Scots start to wear kilts? There are many stories about it. One story is that the kilt was invented   in the 1720s by an English factory owner, Thomas Rawlinson. Rawlinson had a lot of Scottish workers in his factory and he thought their clothing _ their work. So he cut their long clothes into a shorter skirt. Today, most Scotsmen see kilts as formal dresses. They usually only wear them at weddings or big dinners. There are only a few men who still wear a kilt every day.

370,"Retirement Age Retirement is the point where a person stops employment completely.The "" standard"" retirement age varies from country to country, but it is generally between 50 and 70, according to the latest statistics, 2011.However, for a long time, people have got into an argument about whether the age of retirement should be increased or reduced in their own countries. There are several arguments for allowing older people to continue working as long as they are able.Many people think that older employees have a large amount of knowledge and experience which can be lost to a business or organization if they are made to retire.Besides, older employees are often extremely faithful employees to and are more willing to _ company policies than the young.A more important point is regarding the attitudes in society to old people.To force someone to resign or retire at 60 or 65 indicates that the society does not value the input of these people and that effectively their useful life is over. Allowing old people to work indefinitely  , however, is not always a good policy.Some people took the strong view that age alone is no guarantee of ability.Many young employees have more experience or skills than older staff, who may have been stuck in one area for most of their working lives.Having compulsory retirement allows new ideas in an organization.On the other hand, older people should be rewarded by society for their life' s labor by being given generous pensions and the freedom to enjoy leisure.They can have time to do whatever they like, that is, they can have their own plans or roles and achieve their retirement goals. With many young people unemployed or frustrated in low-level positions, there are often calls to compulsorily retire older workers.However, this can affect the older individual' s freedom--and right--to work.In my opinion, giving workers more choices over their retirement age will benefit society and the individual. According to the passage, older people should go on with work because   _  .",they will help the business not to fail quickly,they have grasped much practical experience,they need to have a sense of achievement,they want to learn more knowledge,B

Of course, all he could talk about was the only player anyone wants to talk about these days: New York Knicks guard Jeremy Lin. Hours before Lin took the court against the Heat, a few hundred miles South down I-95 in Miami, Stern told reporters that Lin's instant popularity hasn't ever been matched in sports history, not even by Sunday's biggest names, LeBron James or Kobe Bryant. The Associated Press had the details. ""I haven't done a calculation, but it's fair to say that no player has created the interest and the craze in this short period of time, in any sport, that I'm aware of like Jeremy Lin has,"" Stern said Thursday. Lin, an undrafted guard from Harvard, has become the NBA's biggest story since coming off the Knicks' bench earlier this month to lead them to nine wins in 11 games heading into their matchup with Miami on Thursday night. With Lin's popularity in Asia as the league's first American-born player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent, and with the religious community because of his strong Christian faith, Stern says he's ""never quite seen anything like"" the attention on Lin. ""It's fascinating,"" Stern said after the All-Star Jam Session opening ceremonies. The top five videos on NBA.com since Feb. 4, when Lin joined the circulation, are all Lin or Knicks related.

376,"America's love of cars and being on the open road has led to the creation of the modern travel orcamping trailer . Some trailers are so well equipped that people can comfortably live in them full time. Almost allcampers   are considered as recreational vehicles (RV's). RV's include motor homes, trailers, house trailers and truck campers. The smaller trailers usually have just enough room for two people to sleep and store a few personal travel items. Some of the larger motor homes include a kitchen, a bathroom, an eating area and even a bedroom. While tent camping is always an adventure, campers are a fun way to take a long trip, or to spend some more comfortable time in a beautiful setting, like a lakeside campground. So many camper trailers have been designed for people to live in the trailer long term. Some people choose to park their trailers in trailer parks and live in their trailers full time. In America many retired adults choose to spend their time traveling across the country on the open road and bring their trailers with them. Full time use of trailers for these travelers is considered to be arecreational  activity. Camper trailers can also be rented and used for a shorter period of time, such as a camping trip or a road trip. A camper trailer can be a comfortable _ to sleeping in a tent if you are camping.

The unpunctual man, on one hand, never does what he has to do at the proper time. He is always in a hurry and in the end loses both time and his good name. A lost thing may be found again, but lost time can never be regained. Time is more valuable than material things. In fact, time is life itself. The unpunctual man is for ever wasting and mismanaging his most valuable asset   as well as other's. The unpunctual person is always complaining that he finds no time to answer letters, or return calls or keep appointments promptly. But the man who really has a great deal to do is very careful of his time and seldom complains of want of it. He knows that he can not get through his huge amount of work unless he faithfully keeps every piece of work when it has to be attended to. Failure to be punctual in keeping one's appointments is the sign of disrespect towards others. If a person is invited to dinner and arrives later than the appointed time, he keeps all the other guests waiting for him. Usually this will be regarded as a great disrespect to the host and all other guests present. Unpunctuality, moreover, is very harmful when it comes to do one's duty, whether public or private.

Women lose because, 25 years after the Equal Pay Act, many of them still get paid less than men. They lose because they do lower-paid jobs which men just won't consider. And they lose because they are the ones who interrupt a career to have children.  All this is reported in an independent study ordered by the Government's women's unit. The biggest problem isn't equal pay in workplaces such as factories. It is the sort of work women do. Make a list of low-paid-jobs, then consider who does them.

Besides, more than half of their first evaluation is based on (......) color alone. That's why so many companies are researching their color choices. They are spending thousands of dollars on the research, too. Just think of UPS's Pullman brown, Home Depot's orange and Tiffany & Co.'s blue. Joclyn Benedetto is a spokeswoman for Tiffany & Co. She said the success of the company's jewelry   was connected to its blue color. It is used to wrap   every product.

391,"Japanese people work very hard at studying English. They start studying English at the age of 12. Most young Japanese people spend a lot of time and work hard at studying English, but Japanese people are not good at English. Here are the reasons: There are few people from English-speaking countries in Japan. They don't have enough chances to speak with them. Japan is an island country and they feel that other countries are far away. So they don't use English very often. And the Japanese feel that it is strange  to talk to each other in English. The Japanese education doesn't always follow the educational trends  in the world. It puts a lot of importance on grammar and vocabulary, and less on speaking, listening and reading skills. Many Japanese students' English becomes worse  after they go to university .They have to learn English again if they work in English-speaking countries. Sometimes the Japanese feel shy about speaking wrong or broken English.

392,"Nowadays, many children spend hours a day looking at computer screens or other digital   products. Some eye care doctors say all the screen time has caused more children to have what they call computer vision syndrome  . Nathan Warford is an optometrist in the US. He says he has seen more children having eye problems. ""More children come into my office because their parents have noticed that they have headaches  or red eyes, or because their degree of short-sightedness appears to be increasing  very fast and they're worried,"" he said. Dr. Warford says part of the problem is that even if their eyes start to feel uncomfortable or they start to get a headache, some children don't tell their parents, because they don't want their games or the computer to be taken away. Another part of the problem is that people blink   less often when they look at the screen.A person who uses a computer or a digital product blinks about a third as much as we normally  do in everyday life. If eyes can't stay wet or are too tired, they will not be protected like normal. Why don't some children tell their parents when their eyes start to feel uncomfortable?",They think it is not serious.,They want to continue playing computer games.,They don't want their parents to worry.,Their parents don't care about them.,B

They arrive at the agricultural town of Awassa where Yohannes opens the sides of the cart to display, not the usual vegetables or tools, but children's books. This is the Donkey Mobile Library, the first of its kind in Ethiopia and one of only a few in the world. Yohannes was born in Ethiopia, North Africa, but trained to be a librarian in the USA and returned to Ethiopia years ago. The cart is full of picture books donated by American libraries, teachers and school children. Yohannes arranges small painted benches in the shade of the trees, and suddenly Ethiopian children come shouting and racing down every road and path. It's mobile library day! They circle the bookshelves with great excitement. Until the Donkey Mobile Library began its regular two-monthly visits, many of these children had never seen a book. ""Without books, education is very dull, like food without salt. You can survive but you can't really come alive,"" says Yohannes. ""The ability to read is the basis for greater productivity, better health and longer life. Even though the children lack material goods, with books they can imagine a world of possibilities."" Yohannes first worked in the children's section of the main library in America. Surrounded by books he had never seen before, he realized how joyful and imaginative children's literature is. He says, ""I always thought of Ethiopia. But how could I bring children's books to my home country when it had almost no libraries to keep the books in?"" He contacted Jane Kurtz, a writer born in America but brought up in Ethiopia, and together they created the Donkey Mobile Library. The children say that the Library has given them ideas about what they might do in the future. A child called Dareje wants to be a scientist and find a cure for life-threatening diseases. An eleven year-old girl, Fikerte, wants to do research about the moon and discover new facts about outer space. Tamrat, aged 10, comes every time.

396,"An early invention by Albert Einstein has been rebuilt by scientists at Oxford University. They are trying to develop an environmentally friendly refrigerator that runs without electricity. We all know that modern fridges cause damage to the environment. They work by using a kind of man-made greenhouse gas called Freon  , which is far more damaging than carbon dioxide. Now Malcolm McCulloch, an electrical engineer at Oxford, is leading a three-year project to develop appliances that can be used in places without electricity. His team has completed a prototype   of a fridge patented in 1930 by Einstein. It used only pressurized gases to keep things cold. The design was partly used in the first refrigerators, but the technology was dropped when more efficient compressors   became popular in the 1950s. That meant a switch to using Freon. Einstein's idea uses butane   and water and takes advantage of the fact that liquids boil at lower temperatures, when the air pressure around them is lower. ""If you go to the top of Mount Qomolangma, water boils at a much lower temperature than it does when you're at sea level and that's because the pressure is much lower up there,"" said McCulloch.At one side is the evaporator  , a bottle that contains liquid butane. ""If you introduce a new vapor above the butane, the liquid boiling temperature decreases and, as it boils off, it takes energy from the surroundings to do so,"" says McCulloch. ""That's what makes it cold."" The gas fridges based on Einstein's design were replaced by Freon-compressor fridges partly because Einstein's design was not very efficient. But McCulloch thinks that by changing the design and replacing the types of gases used it will be possible to quadruple   the efficiency. However, McCulloch's fridge is still in its early stages. ""It's very much a prototype,"" he said. ""Give us another month and we'll have it working."" Which of the following is TRUE according to the text?",Freon was used in fridges long before the 1950s.,Freon is what makes current fridges big polluters.,McCulloch thinks he could improve Einstein's design by using other types of vapors.,The fridge Malcolm McCulloch and his team designed will be put into production soon.,B
397,"While in Banff, make time for a walk around town. A special treat is to go up the mountainside on the Banff Gondola for a surprising view of the valley below. Here is The Pines, whose cook has developed a special way of mixing foreign food such as caribou, wild boar, and reindeer with surprising sauces. Best time to visit is during the off-season, from early May to mid-June, or in October. This way you can avoid sharing the highway with mobile homes which can be pulled by cars. But whatever the season, take some lunch with you from Banff, because there are only a few food stops on the road. Forty minutes north of Banff, side by side with the Banff National Park, sits world-famous Lake Louise. This surprisingly small body of water is attractive with towering mountains around it. Glaciers, huge masses of ice, moving very slowly against rocks, produce what is called glacier rock flour, making its water dark to see. It is worth taking a walk around the grounds of the Chateau Lake Louise, another beauty, proud of its early 20th century history. Back on the road, and it's time to continue north past the astonishing Columbia Icefield, then turn off the highway and take the short road to the base of the Athabaska Glacier. You can rent ice cleats   and do some climbing or do a more pleasant snowmobile tour. Either way, you can enjoy endless beautiful sights. Finally you'll reach Jasper, the usual turning around the place for the Banff-Jasper loop  . It's worth riding the Jasper Skytram, and be sure to visit the wonderful Jasper Park Lodge, also dating back to the 1920s. If you can have lunch there, do it. The restaurant has an adventurous menu and their wine list would put a smile on any visitor's face. What will probably happen when visitors come at the end of June?",They may have trouble finding a restaurant.,They may come across traffic jams.,They may travel more easily with cars.,They may do much more sightseeing.,B

406,"With America's national debt continuing to climb, Congress is constantly debating ways to save money. The Dollar Coin Alliance, a lobbying group, says billions could be saved if dollar coins were used instead of paper bills. But many people won't use them. The U.S. government tried to push dollar coins again in recent years, but then suspended almost all production in 2011. American likes paper dollars, but Jim Kolbe, co-chairman of the Dollar Coin Alliance, thinks switching to the coin is worth it. ""The coin does cost more to produce, roughly on the neighborhood of 17 cents versus the 5 or 6 cents that a paper dollar costs to produce,"" he said. ""However, the coin lasts 35 years, and it's made of mostly recycled metals, and the paper has to be produced from new materials, and we shred 3 billion of those every year because they wear out."" For years, the former Arizona congressman has been pushing legislation that would prop up the dollar coin by phasing out the greenback -- a move that has met resistance from both politicians and the public. But today, he said, _ and a recent poll indicates 61 percent of Americans like the idea. ""When they learn of the savings that can be involved with this, they will support the idea of substituting the coin for the paper dollar,"" he said. Major savings Kolbe points to a study by the Government Accountability Office, which investigates how the government spends taxpayer dollars. The GAO estimates taxpayers would save more than $4 billion over 30 years, and that figure could be much higher. That appeals to taxpayer Christy Thompson, who said, ""I'd probably say, yes, we need to do it."" But plenty of people aren't convinced, including Kim Doering of Alexandria, Virginia. ""It's easier to carry the paper bill than a bunch of coins. They're louder; they're heavier in your pocket,"" she said. Washington, D.C. restaurant owner Sue Fouladi doesn't like the idea of having more dollar coins in her cash register. ""It's very inconvenient,"" she said. ""If I don't have a choice, then I'll do it, but I'll be a very unhappy person."" Adding to the problem is that the gold- and silver-colored metal coins are about the same size as the 25-cent quarter. Robert Blecker, an economics professor at American University in Washington, says the dollar coins should be a different size and thickness. ""And if we can design a dollar coin that's not so big and bulky, probably Americans would like it better,"" he added. But that doesn't bother college student Emily Sturgill.

The next day I decided to go back to the park, curious to see if the little girl would still be there. Right in the very spot as she was yesterday, she sat with the saddest look in her eyes. Today I was to make my own move and walk over to the little girl. As we all know, a park full of strange people is not a place for young children to play alone.      As I began walking towards her, I could see the back of the little girl's dress indicated a deformity . I smiled to let her know it was okay, I was there to help, to talk. I sat down beside her and opened with a simple ""Hello"". I smiled and she shyly smiled back. We talked until darkness fell and the park was completely empty. I asked the girl why she was so sad.

So, looking around his study, he saw a magazine with a large map of the world on the cover. He got an idea. He patiently tore the map up into pieces. Then he led his son into the dining room and spread the pieces on the table. He explained to the boy that it was a map of the world. He told the boy to put it back together and they could play together when he finished. Surely this could keep the child busy for hours, he thought.

415,"With the growth of the European Union and increased globalisation, English is increasingly the lingua franc a  in European businesses, and those who speak it have become the elite  of the workforce. In the past, only a few specialists in a company were needed to communicate with foreign businesses.However, in these days of multinational companies, where workers are required to communicate with other employees from several countries, a common language is essential and English has become the logical choice. Nowadays, even blue-collar workers in many companies are required to speak English.For example, just over three years ago, a Dutch company.United Pan-European Communications (UPC), was contracted to build a TV studio in Amsterdam.The job involved many electricians--more than the company could find in the Netherlands.There were plenty of qualified electricians in nearby France and Belgium, but the American and Dutch executives of UPC wanted everyone on the job to speak and understand the same language.So, the UPC hired British electricians and flew them to Amsterdam every Monday, accommodating them in hotels all over the city, and flying them home on Friday evenings. Increasingly, workers who can speak English earn salaries 25-35% higher than those who can' t.They are also eligible   for a wider range of high-level jobs. The problem is that, while the ability to speak English is fast becoming essential for getting a good job, there is a shortage of people who can speak it.According to a recent European Commission report, only about 41% of continental Europeans can speak English, and only 29% speak it well enough to carry on a conversation.Many companies are solving this problem by setting up English language schools within the workplace.English language schools all over Europe are expanding at a huge rate, and governments are looking at ways to improve English tuition in schools. One result of this modem urge to learn English is that a generation gap is appearing. According to a European Union study, 67% of Europeans between 15 and 24 say they can speak English while only 18% of those over 55 say they can.Increasingly, all over Europe, it is the children who are leading the parents.

416,"A newly-published study has shown that loneliness can spread from one person to another, like a disease. Researchers used information from the Framingham Study, which began in 1948. The Framingham Study gathers information about physical and mental health, personal behavior and diet. At first, the study involved about 5,000 people in the American state of Massachusetts. Now, more than 12,000 individuals are taking part. Information from the Framingham Study showed earlier that happiness can spread from person to person. So can behaviors like littering and the ability to stop smoking. University of Chicago psychologist John Cacioppo led the recent study. He and other researchers attempted to show how often people felt lonely. They found that the feeling of loneliness spread through social groups. Having a social connection with a lonely person increased the chances that another individual would feel lonely. In fact, a friend of a lonely person was 52% more likely to develop feelings of loneliness. A friend of that person was 25% more likely. The researchers say this shows that a person could indirectly be affected by someone's loneliness. The effect was strongest among friends. Neighbors were the second most affected group. The effect was weaker on husbands and wives, and brothers and sisters. The researchers also found that loneliness spread more easily among women than men. The New York Times newspaper reports that, on average, people experience feelings of loneliness about 48 days a year. It also found that every additional friend can decrease loneliness by about five percent, or two and a half fewer lonely days. Loneliness has been linked to health problems like depression and sleeping difficulties. The researchers believe that knowing the causes of loneliness could help in reducing it. The study suggests that people can take steps to stop the spread of loneliness. They can do this by helping individuals they know who may be experiencing loneliness. The result can be helpful to the whole social group. What is the main idea of the passage?",Actions should be taken to help lonely people.,People feel lonely for many reasons.,Ways to fight against loneliness.,Lonely people can affect others.,D

Mike is only three months younger than Zac Sunderland, the 17-year-old American boy who had taken the crown as the youngest solo around-the-world sailor in July. The two youngsters met in Cape Town in South Africa as they crossed the globe in different directions. Mike insisted they were not rivals . ""No. It's two teenagers going out there, living their dream and having the adventure of a lifetime,"" he said. Mike may be young, but he is no stranger to sailing adventures. He picked up the hobby at the age of 6 when his father took him out in a small boat on a local lake. Father and son sailed separate boats across the Atlantic when Mike was 14, making him the youngest person to cross that ocean solo. That record gave him the taste for this even greater challenge. On the recent journey, the scariest moment for Mike came when his sailboat was hit by storms in the southern Indian Ocean. ""We were picked up by what felt like a 60-foot wave and threw down on our side at 90 degrees,"" he said. ""It felt like I was going right over. Stuff was flying around and I just thought 'Oh no'."" At other times, he had to dive into the Pacific and fix problems.

The digital books are light, easy on the eyes and let readers carry around as many as 200 titles in hardware that weighs less than a pound. But to some people, there's something missing. ""It's , I guess, the feel of holding a book that someone really put a lot of effort into writing,"" said Katy Farina, 21. Farina, a college student who was browsing   at a bookstore, said, ""It feels real, while the reader separates you a little bit from the story."" Harry Howe, a professor, said he might use an e-book reader in search of materials while away from home, but not for reading a novel. ""It's just not a physical experience that I'm yet comfortable with. On the other hand, I didn't grow up reading things on websites."" Farina said she would like a reader for travelling because she would not have to transport so many books. ""To put 10 books on your Sony reader or on your Kindle is a lot better than carrying 10 books,"" she said.

But now a high-tech car sticker that's designed to be stuck to a car's windscreen, could help motorists avoid such a situation by allowing a traffic warden to get in touch with them. The TowStop sticker sends a text message to a driver when it is touched by a traffic warden, to allow motorists to send a reply and give them time to move their car immediately. It's designed to save drivers time and money by giving them a chance to move their car instead of having it towed  away but relies on the good will of traffic wardens. Frankfurt-based IT consultant , Daniel Kalliontzis, came up with the idea and is raising funds on Indiegogo to put his EUR54 (PS43) sticker into production. Car owners can buy the sticker and place it inside their car's windscreen, having set it up with important information, such as their phone number. The message will ask them to move their car immediately .The driver could then type a reply for the warden using their smartphone, which will appear on the sticker's screen. They may choose to write something along the lines of back in two minutes in a bid to avoid a fine. The smart sticker system will rely on the good will of traffic wardens and critically, a German law. The law states: An officer has to choose the most efficient and inexpensive way for the car owner to remove the vehicle. It could be cheaper for the authorities to contact the driver than to tow his car.

429,"In traditional Chinese medicine, the body, mind and spirit cannot be divided and so the unique whole-body treatment in Tui Na can also be a useful treatment correcting any imbalances in the body's energy before symptoms and disease can develop. It also works to bring back emotional peace as well as physical health. This is why after a Tui Na treatment many people ""feel good"". Many people in China use Tui Na regularly to keep healthy and to deal with some specific illnesses. Tui Na is performed on the clothed body and the patient is either lying on a couch or sitting on a chair. Therapists , by using a variety of movements, will control the intensity  and direction of pressure in an exact way. The unique rolling movement in Tui Na is one of the most difficult movements to learn and students have to practice sometimes for many months on a rice bag before they are allowed to practice on the human body. Stress  Tui Na is of course very useful for treating stress. It spreads the energy around the whole body. It is believed that Tui Na moves the strong energy in the tight muscles to the weaker areas, thus making a more balanced body. When your energy flowing inside your body is balanced, you feel relaxed and comfortable. Tui Na is especially useful for  _ shoulders and tight neck muscles. Emotions  In Traditional Chinese Medicine each major organ  is linked to an emotion. By balancing the energy in the organ, the related emotion will be calmed. When your emotions are out of control, you would usually turn to your doctor or perhaps a psychotherapist  . But perhaps some people would not like to be seeing a psychotherapist or feel nervous about discussing their problems with others. With Tui Na, one does not need to tell the therapist anything one does not want to. The treatment of Tui Na can deal with the problem itself. But if one does need to pour out his/her worries or troubles, an active dialogue between the psychotherapist and the patient will help to get a better effect. Organs & Emotions  Each major organ -- the heart, the stomach, the liver  , the lungs, and etc.--are linked to a relevant emotion. The heart is linked to joy, excitement and sadness. If the heart is out of balance, the patient may dream a lot at night and often forget something important in the day. The stomach is connected with too much thinking or worrying about anxiety. When the stomach is out of balance there is often a lack of energy. The patient often feels very tired and has no interest in doing anything at all. The liver is linked to anger. In Chinese medicine, the eyes are connected with the liver, and many people who suffer from anger often suffer from eye problems. The lung rules decision-making and too much energy here can lead to rashness  , while if there is too little, it can bring about indecision. When there is a history of depression with a patient, it may have effect on the liver. ks5u Tui Na can help release most of the discomfort and it is used in almost all the hospitals in China and very popular among Chinese people. It is a useful and valuable method for the balance of your energy flowing, when emotional and physical health is out of balance. Tui Na is one of the remaining secrets of Chinese medicine.

The nightlife never seems to stop and the people are all very friendly. You can meet people and practice Spanish while having fun at the same time. What I liked least was the fact that many people smoked in the streets.

Barbara, 44, who came to The City in 1970, have been trying to pick herself up from the bottom, where she and her children started out with just the clothes on their backs-through the  kindness of others they got by. They were last homeless in 1999. Since then, Barbara has worked hard to keep from returning to the streets and the shelters, taking advantage first of transitional  housing, then a rent assistance, and studying for a job as a nursing assistant and a home health aide. However the cost for housing has made it difficult for her to  _ . She can't afford proper housing. Even an improper shelter costs as much as $ 1,200 for rent. She has to spend every night in a dining room. In this respect, she is not alone. There are hundreds of thousands of San Franciscans who are in the same boat with her. Since 2000, she's been providing health care in the homes of charity , and relying on an assistance program to pay the rent for her two-bedroom apartment in the Lower Height. A few months ago she lost her full-time job due to budget cuts, just as she had hoped to get a permanent post that would allow her to cover her $ 1,700 monthly rent.  Now she works three or four hour shifts six days a week for $ 10.50 an hour, taking the bus around from client to client and worrying that in February, when her rent assistance is gone, she could end up on the streets with her family again.

434,"If you prefer doughnuts  to dumbbells , you have a high chance of developing diabetes  later in life. But if you wash down those doughnuts with at least seven cups of coffee a day, you are only half as likely as that.  The finding is ""quite surprising and fairly dramatic"", says Bill Hartnett of UK Diabetes, although the patients' group won't be advising people to drink lots of coffee just yet. While there's little evidence that one or two cups a day is harmful, some studies suggest that heavy coffee drinkers are unusually sensitive to pain, easier to fearful disorders and can also have higher blood pressure, which increase the risk of heart disease.  The study was done by Rob van Dam's team at the National Institute for Public Health and Environment in the prefix = st1 /Netherlands, which analysed the data on 171,111 men and women. The team found that those who drank seven or more cups of coffee a day were 50 percent less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who drank two cups of coffee or fewer a day. This was despite the fact that the heavy coffee drinkers tended to have sedentary  lifestyles, which increases the risk of developing diabetes.  ""It's too early to get excited,"" warns Edwin Gale, a diabetes specialist in Britainat theUniversityofBristol. ""It may just be that coffee drinkers behave differently,"" he says.  Type 2 diabetes used to appear mainly in older people, but as levels of obesity (being fat) have increased in children, so has the disease in common. It's a serious disorder--high blood sugar levels damage many organs, and can lead to anything from blindness to kidney  failure.  It usually occurs when the body becomes less sensitive to insulin , the hormone that tells cells to take in too much blood glucose. Caffeine isn't an obvious remedy   for type 2 diabetes, because its immediate effect is to lower sensitivity to insulin. _   is the root of diabetes according to the passage.",The hormone insulin,Doughnuts,High blood sugar,The level of obesity,C
435,"Long queues at cinemas buying hot tickets for blockbusters  will become rare as Beijing residents will be able to order film tickets via cell phone networks in a month. Film ticket circulation service on cell phone, also called the ""Green channel of film tickets ordering"", is aiming at lowing the cost of ticket circulation and easing the ticket distribution pressure on such popular film-watching days as summer and winter vacations or Valentine's Day. ""People log onto the net through cell phones, then choose cinema seats, _ , browse information for new films and read cinema introductions,"" said Guan Zheng, the publicity chief of Xingmei Digital Media Company Ltd., the service provider. ""Film fans can enjoy various discount prices if they order tickets via cell phones,"" Guan said. Meanwhile, the cell phone ticket circulation platform provides subscribers general mobile phone services like jokes, videos, flashes, phone ring downloads and games. The service is about to be put into trial at the Beijing-based Xingmei International Cinema for a month before being putting into use at other cinema chains both in and outside Beijing, as the service is going to be improved through gradual expansion, said Guan. China's film industry that is being restored has seen more and more enthusiastic moviegoers. Up to the end of 2009, China has had more than 5,000 specialized cinemas, among which there are 2,243 modern cinemas with 3, 668 silver screens and 56 cinema chains. Currently, many people buy film tickets on the Internet or by phoning the cinema's ticket office or simply queuing at the cinema gate. More people want to buy tickets on popular days like May Day holiday, National Day holiday or Valentine's Day. Yet the inefficient ticket circulation system contributes the most to the failure.

437,"Windows 8, apart from Windows 95, is the biggest surprise and the only version of Microsoft' s operating system that has been changed from the core when compared to its former one. However, a recent study has shown that under 20% of business owners would be willing to upgrade to the new version of Windows. The reason for this remains to be discussed and debated, and we will try to throw light on this research by providing you with some of the most common advantages and disadvantages of Windows 8. Generally speaking, there are a great number of plus sides related to upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 8. Speed -- This is the biggest advantage to mention. Boot time has been reported to be up to nine times shorter than that with Windows 7. New passwords -- Instead of typing your passwords, Windows 8 will let you use gestures on your favorite photos to enter your password. This is not only practical but also extremely cool! Windows 8 experience -- Apart from computers, Windows 8 will be used on all devices, including smart phones, tablet PC's and so on. Also, owing to the fact that it has been specifically designed with touch screen users in mind, Windows 8, besides using keyboard and mouse, will offer a whole new user experience. However, there are still some disadvantages. The first one that has to be mentioned is that there is no Start Menu from Windows. Yes, there is no Start button in the lower left corner, and this might be a real puzzle of many Windows users. Also, many users have had a problem to get used to the new interface introduced by Windows 8. The biggest problem that is worth noticing is that Windows 8 was originally designed for touch screen users, and this may have a bad effect on desktop users who have gotten used to doing everything with the help of their keyboard and mouse. From the text we can learn that Windows 8  _  .",no longer requires a password,was upgraded from windows 95,will be popular with desktop users,can be used on more than computers,D
438,"Everybody cheats. Whether it's the taxi driver who tricks a visitor and takes them the long way round, or the shop assistant who doesn't give the correct change, or the police officer who accepts a bribe   - everybody's at it. Cheats in the nest include the scientist whose research was based on fake data, the game show competitors who worked with a friend in the audience or win a million pounds, and the doctor who made up his qualifications and wasn't really a doctor at all. Everybody cheats; nobody's playing the game. Is cheating acceptable, a natural way of surviving and being successful? Or is it something that should _ , and young people discouraged from doing? If it's the latter how can we explain to children why so many bend the rules? Take sport for example. The Word Cup was filled with cheating. Whether diving, pretending to be hurt or denying a handball, footballers will do anything for a free - kick or a penalty shot. France striker Henry denied cheating to win the free - kick which led to his side's second goal in their 3 - 1 victory over Spain. Many footballers, however, are often putting it on. Whatever the nationality there's one common ploy: the player rolls over holding their leg, ankle or head seeming to be in great pain. As a result a yellow card and / or free - kick is given for the foul and then, a few seconds later, the player is up and about as if nothing had happened ! The ref   may be taken in by it but youngsters watching the game aren't. they also see their heroes getting away with it. Of course it's not just football. In 1998 the Tour de France, the world's greatest cycling event, was hit by a drug - taking scandal  . The 40 bottles of forbidden drugs found with the Fustian team caused a massive investigation that almost caused the Tour to be abandoned. One rider, Veronique, was banned for 9 months. He claimed: ""You have cheats in sport, just as you do in business - there will always be people trying to take a short cut. At least we're not turning a blind eye to the problem, which other sports are."" Is it all unavoidable? There's huge pressure on all athletes to perform for their fans and for their sponsors. It's success, money and power that rule professional sport rather than an honest at tempt to do the best one can. Meanwhile companies around the world are losing billions of dollars to fake products. From cut price CDs and DVDs to sportswear, cheap fake products are everywhere. It has become socially acceptable to buy fake Gucci bags and illegal copies of films. If parents are doing this, their children will follow. So perhaps it's not surprising that around the world more pupils than ever are caught cheating during exams. In one case missing exam papers were put up for sale on the Internet. In another, widespread cheating took place by pupils using their mobile phones to receive tested answers. They blame the pressure put on them to do well in exams. It doesn't help that their role models are also cheats. Surely we can't complain when we're setting such a bad example. According to the passage, in which way can a game show player cheat?",By taking an indirect way.,By gaining aid from a friend.,By taking forbidden drugs.,By selling fake products.,B

Even Her Majesty's pet dogs receive meals of lamb and cabbage in silver bowls. Good thing the kitchen is well stocked--- the Queen welcomes about 50,000 dining guests every year. 2. CLASSY COACH The Queen's most attractive ride may be the Gold State Coach, parked in the palace's Royal Mews building and used in the crowning of a king or queen, since 1821. Covered with heavy gold, it's pulled by eight horses. 3. MOVIE NIGHT The royal family hosts private screenings of movie in their very own cinema, sometimes seeing new films before they hit theaters. 4. WHAT'S UP, DOC? Forget a medicine cabinet  . Buckingham Palace houses a doctor's office run by the Queen's physician. And surgeons have performed operations in other parts of the palace. In 1902, for instance, doctors operated on King Edward VII in a room facing the garden. 5. BEDROOMS The palace has 52 bedrooms. Rooms such as those inside the Belgian Suite contain chandeliers , gold-gilded mirrors, fireplaces, canopy beds, and more. 6. TOP- SECRET TUNNELS Rumor has it that secret underground tunnels connect the royal residence to other buildings in London.

Everybody worked to keep the garden growing. All summer long, the family ate food from the garden and enjoyed the beautiful flowers. Grandma made jam with strawberry, tomatoes, beans, peppers, pears and peaches. It was good to eat through the long winter.

Everyone still enjoyed the good food from the garden and always took some home. Grandchildren grew up, and grandparents grew older. It became harder for Grandma and Grandpa to keep up the garden.

VJs were first seen on television in the early 1980s when MTV went on the air. As MTV became popular, and the audience for music videos expanded, a variety of other music video channels started broadcasting. In addition to rock music, there were channels for people who had a lot of interest in alternative kinds of music, such as country music, light music, and R&B(rhythm and blues), and all of these channels needed VJs. By the 1990s, international music video channels like Channel V in Asia and VIVA in Europe had started. The VJs for the new international stations had to be chosen carefully. Although some VJs did shows that focused on small audiences and showed mostly local content, other VJs presented shows for international viewers. These VJs, and the material they presented, needed to be popular in several different cultures. One successful international VJ in Asia is Asha Gill.

By contrast, only one in eight university graduates had failed to fly the nest by the same age 20 years ago. It also found that grown-up sons are twice as likely as their sisters to still be living with their parents in their late 20s. With nearly a quarter of men approaching 30 still living at home, the findings are bound to lead to claims of a ""generation of mummy's boys"". Young professionals in their late 20s or early 30s have been nicknamed the ""boomerang generation"" because of the trend toward returning to the family home having initially left to study. Recent research has suggested that young people in Britain are twice as likely to choose to live with their parents in their late 20s than their counterparts elsewhere in Europe.  Growing housing prices, rising student debts and the effects of recession  on the job market have forced a wave of young people to move back into the family home at an age when they would normally be moving out. But commentators warned that the phenomenon may have more to do with young people facing "" _ "" prospects than simply a desire to save money. While the proportion of those of university or college age moving out from the family home has continued to rise in the last 20 years, among those in their mid and late 20s the trend has been reversed. Overall 1.7 million people aged from 22 to 29 now share a roof with their parents, including more than 760,000 in their late 20s.

450,"You are watching a film in which two men are having a fight. They hit one another hard. At the start they only fight with their fists .But soon they begin hitting one another over the heads with chairs. And so it goes on until one of the men crashes through a window and falls thirty feet to the ground below. He is dead! Of course he isn't really dead. With any luck he isn't even hurt. Why ? Because the men who fall out of high windows or jump from fast moving trains, who crash cars of even catching fire, are professionals .They do this for a living. These men are called stuntmen. That is to say, they perform tricks . There are two sides to their work. They actually do most of the things you see on the screen. For example, they fall from a high building. However, they do not fall on to hard ground but on to empty cardboard boxes covered with a mattress . Again, when they hit one another with chairs, the chairs are made of soft wood and when they crash through windows, the glass is made of sugar! But although their work depend on trick of this sort, it also requires a high degree of skill and training. Often a stuntman's success depends on careful timing .For example, when he is ""blown up"" in a battle scene, he has to jump out of the way of the explosion just at the right moment. Naturally stuntmen are well paid for their work, but they lead dangerous lives. They often get seriously injured, and sometimes killed. A Norwegian stuntman, for example, skied over the edge of a cliff a thousand feet high. His parachute failed to open, and he was killed. In spite of all the risks, this is no longer a profession for men only. Men no longer dress up as women when actresses have to perform some dangerous action. For nowadays there are stuntgirls too!

451,"About 12 years ago, I began making a series of dolls called ""Wee Mountain Folk."" At first, I made them from cloth but then began using a kind of polymer clay called cernit. The cloth dolls were beautiful, but it was impossible to get the level of detail I can get with clay. First, I use wire to build the shape of the doll. Then I cover the head, hands, and feet around the wire using the cernit. Then I make the doll's clothes myself, using lots of different materials. The completed dolls are fixed onto hardwood bases made by my father, Jim Logan. Generally, the dolls I make show older people taking part in traditional activities. I've always had a great respect for the older generation. Inspiration for the dolls often comes from people I know. Once I was caught looking too closely at the wrinkles on the face of one of my mom's friends. But I explained that her laugh lines made her more attractive. Now I work as a teacher's assistant, and while I was raising my two daughters, Keri and Sheryl, I could work on the dolls only late in the day. The girls loved to come downstairs the next morning to see who'd arrived in the night. It's the detail that I enjoy working on the most. I once made a fisherman doll for a lady to give her father, including a tiny creel -- a basket used by fishermen for carrying fish. When the man got the doll, he immediately opened the creel to see what was inside. Luckily, I'd made a small fish out of cernit and placed it in the basket. Hopefully my story will inspire others to try their hand at doll making -- I find it very relaxing and interesting.

452,"When a big exam is coming up, you probably feel anxious about any wasted time and want to begin school as soon as you probably can. But tens of thousands of British high school students will soon be getting up later. They're taking part in a new experiment by Oxford University to see if later classes can improve their exam results. Grades 10 students in the UK have to take the nationwide General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) exams. They have to pass these exams in order to study more advanced courses, and later apply for universities. The Oxford University project means that GCSE students from more than 100 schools across England will start school at 10 am, more than one hour later than the current start time (8:50 am). The project is based on scientific evidence that teenagers are ""out of sync "" with traditional school hours, the Telegraph reported. And what they need is more sleep in the morning. ""We know that something funny happens when you're a teenager, in that you seem to be out of sync with the world,"" said professor Colin Epsie, who is leading the study. ""Your parents think it's because you are lazy and opinionated and everything will be OK if you could get to sleep earlier. But science is telling us that teenagers need to sleep more in the mornings."" Everyone follows a natural cycle of sleep and wakefulne ss. Biology has decided that teenagers go to sleep around midnight and don't feel fully awake until 9-10 am, according to scientists. That's two hours later than adults. And their body clocks stay like this until the age of around 21 for males, and 19 for females. ""Society provides school for learning, but the brain provides sleep. So we are exploring the possibility that if you delay the schools start time until 10 am, that will improve learning performance,"" said Epsie. The results could be positive, based on previous studies. An early study at the UK's Monkseaton High School in 2009 found that starting an hour later improved grades in core subjects by 19 percent.

454,"Dear Florence, We arrived in India last week, and the voyage was the worst experience of my entire life. I'm lucky to be alive! The first part of the journey was terrible, because the ship hit bad weather almost as soon as we left Liverpool. But much, much worse was to come. Later, we were involved in a collision with another boat and we had to abandon ship! We had been at sea for about two weeks and we were in the Mediterranean. There is now a canal between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea called the Suez Canal, which opened last year. Our boat stopped at Port Said, the Egyptian port at the entrance to the canal. I remember looking through the porthole of my cabin and wishing that I could go ashore and visit this fascinating place, but mummy had ordered that I was to stay in the cabin because I was feeling ill. ""you must stay here for at least another two days."" I remember her saying. How wrong she would turn out to be! The ship left the port and headed towards the canal . I was alone in the cabin and I watched the port disappear into the distance. Suddenly there was a loud bang, followed by the most awful crunching sound, and the ship shook and turned slightly on its side. There was an for a moment, then people started shouting. Mummy came running into the cabin and told me that we had collided with another boat. She took my hand and we ran along the deck towards the lifeboats. There was a lot of shouting and people were running everywhere, but the crew were all acting calmly, helping people into the lifeboats and telling people not to panic. Well, clearly we survived, as did all the passengers and crew of the ship. The other boat wasn't so lucky. It sank and several lives were lost. I will write about the rest of the journey soon. Please give my love to Aunt Claire and Uncle Eric. Your loving cousin, Jane 58.The author's mother didn't allow her to go ashore and visit the port city, Said because    _    .",she was homesick at that time,she didn't feel very well then,she could meet some danger ashore,she could see the city through the porthole on board,B
455,"Does your local town have a nickname? If so, what does it say about the area and the people who live there? Many cities are recognized across the world by  their unofficial names. New York is the Big Apple, London is the Big Smoke, and Los Angeles is famously called La La Land. Now, as part of English Language Day on Wednesd ay, two British organizations, the English Project and Ordnance Survey, are launching    an interactive project which aims to identify the nicknames which people use in their daily lives for the places which they like or dislike. ""The name that people create for a place forms a connection with feelings,"" explains Winchester University's Professor Bill Lucas, a patron   of the English Project. ""So Basingstoke becomes Amazingstoke; Swindon is known as Swindump and Padstow, hometown of chef Rick Stein, is nicknamed Padstein."" Basingstoke is a town in central England. The local nickname, Amazingstoke, shows the love that locals seem to have for the area. Swindon, on the other hand, is sometimes called Swindump, showing that some people think it's a dump ( ). Stanford Le Hope in Essex is  called Stanford No Hope by locals. And Padstow in Cornwall is so closely connected with the local famous person Rick Stein that it's become known as Padstein. Since launching the online survey last week, the creators have already received 3,000 alternative titles for places and landmarks. As well as creating what promises to be a fascinating resource of nicknames, there is a practical side to the project. ""With the huge variety of place nicknames that exist, we could never hope to collect them all ourselves,"" says Glen Hart, Ordnance Survey's head of research. ""But the information from the project could prove vital. Organizations like the emergency services rely on our information when responding to 999 calls, so by having the most complete set of nicknames we could help the emergency services quickly locate the right place, and maybe even save lives."" What does Glen Hart think of the project?",It proves that most nicknames are interesting.,It may help increase the number of nicknames.,It is very helpful to emergency services.,It has helped prevent deaths from happening.,C

That is not to say that there are no cool shirts out there for girls to wear. The problem is that they are often harder to find than the ones for boys. You can get custom   shirt printed for girls from a number of custom print stores. Of course you have to make sure that they are legally allowed to use the logos   and colours of the team you want to support. You can also go through official channels to get the shirt you want. The official channels will generally be the large sportswear stores or the official stores of the teams. These stores will be able to use the colours of the teams and even put the name of the person who the shirt is for on it. If you do not feel like you have to try the T-shirts on, then an online store may be your best choice. The reason for this is that you can visit various stores and find the best ones.

460,"Over the last six years I have learned what patience is. Growing up I did not have this virtue and it is a very important virtue to have. Now I can see that if you are patient you will almost always get what you want if you are supposed to have it. I gained patience when I lost my freedom. I knew that I would eventually get it back in time. I was locked up in prison for a period of six years because at 19 years old I was playing with a handgun and I accidentally shot and killed my friend. The first couple of years was the hardest.I was always stressed out about everything.Time was dragging by because I was always paying attention to it.While I was locked up,Tom who I talked to helped put this virtue in me.He told me that it was possible that he would never make it home but that being patient and believing that one day he would was what had made him feel better.After a while I realized why he said a lot of things to me.Once I stopped paying attention to the days and just kept in mind that I would get freedom,it seemed that my time passed quickly. Now I am home and can see that patience paid off for me. I now use this virtue in my daily activities. I know that sometimes life gets hard and that it will pay in the end to stay patient and not to get discouraged.

461,"People hold different views on what or how much homework should be. It is partly due to  the fact that people can't seem to agree on the purpose of homework. Some teachers think that homework is necessary to reinforce  what is learned in school. And so they ask their students to memorize what was discussed in class through homework. Some teachers think the point of homework is to cover material that the class didn't have time to get to, so their homework is to let students learn additional things. Other teachers like homework simply because they want students to form work habits and still others believe homework is necessary because it's the best way for parents to learn what their children do in school. However, many parents seem to have different ideas. Elisa Cohen, who has twins at Lafayette Elementary School, doesn't like the fact that third-grade students in DC elementary schools are asked to write about 25 book summaries a year. She said, ""They do the same thing over and over without really getting into alternate   ways of thinking about books, reading and writing."" Some education reformers  , such as Howard Gardner, a Harvard University professor well-known for his theory on multiple intelligence, think that Cohen is on the right track. But it's often hard to persuade overworked teachers to give much thought to homework tasks. What's the problem with Elisa Cohen's twins in writing about their book report?",They find homework really hard.,They simply copy one repeatedly.,They get different ways of thinking about their work.,They aren't given much thinking about what they read.,D
462,"I credit my typing skill to so many hours of chatting online. Unfortunately, as my typing speed increased on the Internet, all grammatical rules _ You see instant messages have their own shorthand language and grammar isn't important, of which even a newbie   is aware. They can leave out articles, subjects  , pronouns, etc. They can misspell or ""respell"" almost any word. They often ask ""A/S/L"" when they first chat. Abbreviations   and capitalizations   are particularly important. English-speaking instant messengers also refuse to burden themselves with punctuation and capitalization. After I came back China, I discovered not one but two instant messaging crazes. The first, which brought back memories of my previous addiction to the computer, was QQ. I can see evidence that the Chinese have the same kind of separate instant messaging language, even when they chat in English. My first word in this language, for example, was ""ft"". This abbreviation for ""faint"" is used whenever there is a need to express surprise. I also discovered that Chinese use the same kind of abbreviation for a laugh. And there is an extraordinary number of smileys   to the ""vomit"" and ""army soldier"" smileys. There is even a SARA smiley. After QQ, there is another, perhaps more widespread messaging trend. You guessed it --- cell phone text messaging. I now understand how useful text messaging is and why it is so common. I admit that I have been guilty of sending text messages while walking outside or sitting on the subway. Who hasn't ? No matter where I go, I see people on their cell phones, messaging. In fact, it's rare to see someone actually talking on their phone! So it looks as if there is no escape from the instant messaging crazes, no matter where in the world I go. And that's plainly not going to change. In the end, though, I can't complain: instant messaging is quick, it's cheap, it's easy and it's extremely fun too. And after all, everyone's doing it. Which of the following is true according to the passage?",Grammar and correct spelling are very important while chatting online.,There are enough smileys and icons to express yourselves while chatting on line.,The writer is skilled at typing and once was addicted to online games.,It is impolite to leave out some unimportant words or letters while chatting online.,B

Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without ""outside help"". ""What kind of help is that?"" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out. ""Surgery ,"" one replied. I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job . One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. ""They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"" At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall! It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting ""perfection"" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality. No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that ""perfection"" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost.

465,"A father in Wuhan, nicknamed ""Eagle Dad"" for his controversial parenting style, has dismissed critics' claims that he pushes his 4-year-old son too hard. Police officer Wang Shaoyan came under the spotlight this month after his child took part in an 18-kilometer race in the Hubei provincial capital. Some parents attacked his methods of extreme physical training, while others reacted strongly to his admission that he regularly exposes the youngster to cold showers. ""I just want my son to reach his full potential,"" Wang said, adding that 4-year-old son not only runs 3 km every day he also takes cold showers from time to time to strengthen his body's resistance and willpower. ""He has never taken any sick leave from kindergarten,"" he said proudly. However, some parents find his methods too extreme. ""I'm not sure a 4-year-old is prepared for such intense training,"" said Zhang Ruxia  a woman who gave birth to two boys in October in Tianjin. ""You can have good intentions to train your child at an early age but you also have to consider whether he can take it."" Wang responded by saying children are too young to make decisions, and it is up to parents to lead them on the right path. ""I read many materials before and the whole process is step-by-step without pushing or imposing on my son,"" Wang said. The father said he was not acting rashly but following a scientific way of education. He said the doubts about his methods reflect the declining standards of modern education. ""Many people in Japan give their children cold showers too ,and no one is fussing about it,"" he said. The traditional way of education applied by most of his peers might not necessarily help bring the best out of a child he said. Wang said in addition to the physical training, he has also laid out a detailed and particular program to strengthen the intelligence of the child.

468,"""Mom, I have cancer."" These four words catapulted my son and me on a journey that lasted two years. On that day I felt a wave of paralyzing fear. Scott was the oldest of my four children. He was 33 years old and a successful assistant principal at SamRayburn Hifht School in Pasadena, Texas. He and his wife Carolyn were busy raising four active children. Scott was 6'2'', weighed 200 pounds and had never been sick a day in his life. A few month earlier a mole on his neck had changed color. ""Dr.Warner called,"" Scott said that spring morning. ""It's melanoma. "" I tried to comfort him, naming all the people I knew who had survived skin cancer. Yet, I felt small tentacles of fear begin to wrap around my chest. Our next stop was MDAnderson, the famous cancer hospital in Houston. Scott had surgery at the end of May and was scheduled for radiation treatments over the summer recess. ""There is an 80 percent chance it won't reoccur,"" the doctors said. At the end of summer, all his tests came back negative and Scott was back at school in the fall. However, in December, Scott discovered a lump on his neck. It was examined and the result came back ""malignant. "" We now realized that Scott fell into the 20 percent category. I could feel the tentacles tightening around my chest. He entered the hospital for an aggressive treatment, a combination of interferon and interleukin. After five months of treatment, he had radical surgery on his neck. The test results were encouraging, only three of the 33 lymph nodes  removed were malignant. We were very hopeful. For the next six months, Scott's follow-up visits went well. Then in October, X-ray revealed a spot on his lung. The spot was removed during surgery and the doctors tried to be optimistic. It was a daily battle to control the fear and panic each setback brought. In January, he was diagnosed as having had a ""disease explosion."" The cancer had spread to his lungs, spine and liver and he was given three to six months to live. There were times during this period when I felt like I was having a heart attack. _  When you watch your child battle cancer, you experience a roller coaster of emotions. There are moments of hope and optimism but a bad test result or even an unusual pain can bring on dread and panic. Scott was readmitted to the hospital for one last try with chemotherapy. He died, quite suddenly, just six weeks after his last diagnosis. I was completely destroyed. I had counted on those last few months. The next morning I was busy notifying people and making funeral arrangements. I remember having this nagging feeling that something was physically wrong with me. It took a moment to realize that the crushing sensation in my chest was gone. The thing every parent fears the most had happened. My son was gone. Of course, the fear had been replaced by unbearable sorrow. After you lose a child, it is so difficult to go on. The most minimal tasks, combing your hair or taking a shower, becoming monumental. For months I just sat and stared into space. That spring, the trees began to bloom; flowers began to pop up in my garden. Friendswood was coming back to life but I was dead inside. During those last weeks, Scott and I often spoke about life and death. Fragments of those conversations kept playing over and over in my mind. ""Don't let this ruin your life, Mom."" ""Make sure Dad re models his workshop."" ""Please, take care of my family."" I remember wishing I could have just one more conversation with him. I knew what I would say, but what would Scott say? ""I know how much you love me, Mom. So just sit on the couch and cry."" No, I knew him better than that. Scott loved life and knew how precious it is. I could almost hear his voice saying, ""Get up Mom, Get on with your life. It's too valuable to waste."" That was the day I began to move forward. I signed up for a cake decorating class. Soon I was making cakes for holidays and birthdays. My daughter-in-law told me about a writing class in Houston. I hadn't written in years, but since I was retired I decided it be time to start again. The local college advertised a Life Story Writing class that I joined. There I met women who had also lost their children. The Poet Laureate of Texas was scheduled to speak at our local Barnes and Noble. I attended and joined our local poetry society. I never dreamed that writing essays and poems about Scott could be so therapeutic. Several of those poems have ever been published. In addition, each group brought more and more people into my life.. I don't believe you ever recover from the loss of a child. Scott is in my heart and mind every day. However, I do believe you can survive. Scott fought so bravery to live and he never gave up. He taught me that life is a gift that should be cherished, not wasted. It has taken years to become the person I am today. The journey has been a difficult, painful process but certainly worth the effort and I know that my son would be proud.

469,"The largest campaign of killing rats in history is set to poison millions of rats on the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. Scientists say the campaign planned for 2013 and 2014 will restore beautiful South Georgia to the position it once held as the world's most important nesting sites for seabirds. It was sailors in the late 18th century who unintentionally introduced rats to what had been a fresh environment. ""If we can destroy the rats, at least 100 million birds will return to their home on South Georgia,"" says Tony Martin, a biology professor at the University of Dundee who was invited to lead the project. South Georgia is by far the largest island to get rid of animals that destroy native wildlife after being introduced deliberately or accidentally by people. Though rats and mice have done the most damage, cats, foxes, goats, deer, rabbits and other species have been targeted in the campaigns around the world. South Georgia is seven times the size of New Zealand's Campbell Island, currently the largest area ever killing rats. The successful war against Campbell Island rats was carried out in 2001 with 132 tons of poison dropped from five helicopters. ""New Zealand pioneered the techniques for ridding islands of rats and in fact our operation on South Georgia is based on New Zealand's technology."" Says Martin. ""Some New Zealanders will be helping our campaign, including our chief pilot, Peter Garden, who was also chief pilot for the projects at Campbell Island and Rat Island, in the Aleutian chain of the north Pacific."" The second and third stages in 2013 and 2014 will involve dropping as much as 300 tons of poison from the air onto every part of the island where rats might live. It is a huge operation, carried out during the stormy southern autumn when the rats are hungry and the risks of poisoning native wildlife are less than in the spring and summer months. ""Ideally we'd do in winter but the weather makes that too risky,"" Martin says. The ecological payback will be priceless. But Martin says, ""The full benefits will take decades to arrive, because some of these birds are slow to hatch."" According to the passage, how did the rats appear on the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia?",They were attracted there by wildlife.,They escaped there from Campbell Island.,They were introduced there by sailors accidently.,They were brought in by people deliberately.,C
470,"What if our babies could somehow tell us what they're thinking about, what they want, and what makes them unhappy? Robyn Holt, researcher for Baby Talk New Zealand, says they can. Holt heard about baby sign language through an advertisement and decided to go along to a workshop  . ""Sign language is something that's always interested me, and I thought, it could be really cool to try this with a baby because we are always guessing all the time what they actually want."" Holt started using baby sign language with her baby son Benjamin, now 12, and within two weeks he started to sign the sign for milk. She has since used it with her two younger sons Dominic, 8, and Matthew, 3. Baby sign language is nothing new: the practice (which is based on adult sign language) has been out in America for more than 30 years. But it is enjoying a rebirth in New Zealand. The idea behind baby sign language is that babies do have the ability to communicate their needs if they are given the right tools to do so. Although many mothers develop an intuition   about whether their baby's crying is from hunger, tiredness, or pain, baby sign language creates a direct form of communication that unlocks _ . When babies are between 6-months and 12 to 13-months, parents can begin to teach them sign language: use the sign for milk while feeding, and also talk about milk, so that the child begins to make the link   in their brain. Then they can begin to add other signs, i.e. food, sick or pain. ""I know of one parent. Her child was signing the sign for hurt by his mouth, and she realised his first teeth were growing. It makes life so much easier,"" said Holt. Why did Holt go to the baby sign language workshop?",To entertain her own children.,To better understand babies' needs.,To help babies with language problems.,To develop a new system of sign language.,B

473,"An increase in students applying to study economics   at university is being attributed to  the global economic crisis   awakening a public thirst for knowledge about how the financial system works. Applications for degree courses beginning this autumn were up by 15% this January, according to UCAS, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service. A spokesman for the Royal Economic Society said applications to do economics at A-level were also up. Professor John Beath, the president of the society and a leading lecture at St Andrews University, said his first-year lectures which are open to students from all departments--were drawing crowds of 400, rather than the usual 250. ""There are a large number of students who are not economics majors, who would like to learn something about it. One of the things I have done this year is to relate my teaching to contemporary events in a way that one hasn't traditionally done. "" He added. University applications rose 70% last year. But there were rises above average in several subjects. Nursing saw a 15% jump, with people's renewed interest in careers in the pubic sector , which are seen as more secure in economic crisis. A recent study showed almost two thirds of parents believed schools should do more to teach pupils about financial matters, and almost half said their children had asked them what was going on, although a minority of parents felt they did not understand it themselves well enough to explain. Zack Hocking, the head of Child Trust Funds, said: ""It's possible that one good thing to arise from the downturn will be a generation that's financially wiser and betterequipped(...) to manage their money through times of economic uncertainty."" According to Hocking , the global economic crisis might make the youngsters  _  .",wiser in money management,have access to better equipment,confident about their future careers,get jobs in Child Trust Funds,A

475,"We've considered several ways of paying to cut in line: hiring line standers, buying tickets from scalpers  , or purchasing line-cutting privileges directly from, say, an airline or an amusement park. Each of these deals replaces the morals of the queue (waiting your turn) with the morals of the market (paying a price for faster service). Markets and queues--paying and waiting--are two different ways of allocating things, and each is appropriate to different activities. The morals of the queue, ""First come, first served, have an egalitarian   appeal. They tell us to ignore privilege, power, and deep pockets. The principle seems right on playgrounds and at bus stops. But the morals of the queue do not govern all occasions. If I put my house up for sale, I have no duty to accept the first offer that comes along, simply because it's the first. Selling my house and waiting for a bus are different activities, properly governed by different standards. Sometimes standards change, and it is unclear which principle should apply. Think of the recorded message you hear, played over and over, as you wait on hold when calling your bank: ""Your call will be answered in the order in which it was received."" This is essential for the morals of the queue. It's as if the company is trying to ease our impatience with fairness. But don't take the recorded message too seriously. Today, some people's calls are answered faster than others. Call center technology enables companies to ""score"" incoming calls and to give faster service to those that come from rich places. You might call this telephonic queue jumping. Of course, markets and queues are not the only ways of allocating things. Some goods we distribute by merit, others by need, still others by chance. However, the tendency of markets to replace queues, and other non-market ways of allocating goods is so common in modern life that we scarcely notice it anymore. It is striking that most of the paid queue-jumping schemes we've considered--at airports and amusement parks, in call centers, doctors' offices, and national parks--are recent developments, scarcely imaginable three decades ago. The disappearance of the queues in these places may seem an unusual concern, but these are not the only places that markets have entered. The passage is meant to   _  .",justify paying for faster services,discuss the morals of allocating things,analyze the reason for standing in line,criticize the behavior of queue jumping,B
476,"Some people in Manchester, Britain, will soon be paying for goods and services with so-called ""smart"" credit cards. These cards are more secure than the traditional magnetic-strip version and can be used to travel on buses, check bank accounts and do shopping. The Manchester project is one of the biggest smart card schemes in the world. Every time people use the cards on a bus or train, the fare is deducted (reduced) from the value of the card. When they have no credit left, the cards can be recharged at a local shop. A smart card looks just like a normal plastic card but it has a silicon chip in it. It is possible for the same silicon chip to perform a number of different functions, so one plastic card in your pocket could do a large number of different jobs. The card has much more memory space than a magnetic-strip card, so many more things can be recorded on it.There are two types of smart cards. One is the contact card which is used in the same way as a magnetic-strip card. Information is transferred by running the card through a narrow opening in an electronic reader. In the slot, electronic probes make contact with the magnetic-strip or silicon ship and read the information. The other type is the contactless smart card where the electronic reader communicates with the card by short-range radio waves. This makes the card quicker and more convenient to use because it does not have to leave your wallet.  It is also more reliable as it is not easily influenced by scratches or dirt. However, the biggest advantage that smart cards have over magnetic-strip cards is that they are more secure. They are much more difficult to make than conventional cards and they have to be made by specially trained manufacturers. In addition, they have a large number of extra security features on them and if a smart card gets lost or stolen a quick phone-call to the distributor ensures that its individual number is made invalid and unreadable. This can be done more quickly than with a magnetic-strip card. A smart credit card can do many kinds of jobs because   _   .",it is smart,it is a plastic card,it has a silicon chip in it,it can be recharged,C
477,"The weather across much of Europe and sections of Asia has been very cold since last week. Hundreds of people have died from the cold. It has also been a source of fun for winter sports enthusiasts and has raised doubts about global warming.  Europeans were digging themselves out of heavy snow after a week-long cold snap  in which the number of dead--most of them homeless--continued to rise by the day. The big freeze has caused traffic mess from Siberia to Rome, blocking roads, closing schools, shutting airports, and trapping thousands in remote mountain villages in Europe. Temperatures have fallen as low as 36 degrees below zero in Ukraine, the hardest-hit country. Serbia on Sunday declared an emergency situation, saying the extremely big snowfall has put normal life at risk.   But the deep freeze has also offered opportunities for snowy fun. In Sarajevo, young people snowboarded down white streets. Others competed with videos on YouTube to show the craziest jump into the snow from second floor apartments--most of them wearing only bathing suits. In the Netherlands, Europe's deep freeze means the country's almost imaginary ""Eleven Cities Tour"" ice skating marathon could be staged later this month for the first time in 15 years. The race is expected to draw thousands of participants and more than a million viewers.   The cold snap has also caused people to doubt global warming claims--if the Earth is getting warmer, why have recent winters been colder? Zhang Peiqun, assistant chief engineer of the National Climate Center, explained in an interview with xinhuanet. com: ""Global warming refers to broad changes over a long time period, mainly in the past 100 years. It doesn't contradict with the phenomenon that some time in some places the temperature is lower than usual."" He also added that it has been a long time debate whether the Earth is getting warmer or colder.

The rabbit was quite dirty, as if it had put up quite a struggle, so I washed it, combed it with the dog brush and blew it dry with the leaf blower.Upon finishing its grooming I jumped the fence and replaced it back in its cage hoping its death would be written off as ""natural caused"".

Her father, panic stricken, stood looking at the cage.Being the good neighbor that I am, I rushed to fence and asked if there was anything I could do.

480,"Humans are social animals. They live in groups all over the world. As these groups of people live apart from other groups, over the years and centuries they develop their own habits and ideas, which form different cultures. One important particular side of every culture is how its people deal with time.    Time is not very important in nonindustrial societies. The Nuer people of East Africa, for example, do not even have a word TIME that is in agreement with the abstract thing we call time. The daily lives of the people of such nonindustrial societies are likely to be patterned around their physical needs and natural events rather than around a time schedule based on the clock. They cook and eat when they are hungry and sleep when the sun goes down. They plant crops during the growing seasons and harvest them when the crops are ripe. They measure time not by a clock or calendar ,but by saying that an event takes place before or after some other event . Frequently such a society measures day in terms of""sleeps""of longer periods in terms of""moons"".Some cultures, such as the Eakinos of Greenland measure seasons according to the migration of certain animals.    Some cultures which do not have a written language or keep written records have developed interesting ways of""telling time"".For example, when several Australian aborigines want to plan an event for a future time, one of them places a stone on a cliff or in a tree. Each day the angle of the sun changes slightly. In a few days, the rays of the sun strike the stone in a certain way. When this happens, the people see that the agreed-upon time has arrived and the event can take place.    In contrast ,exactly correct measurement of time is very important in modern, industrialized societies. This is because industrialized societies require the helpful efforts of many people in order to work. For a factory to work efficiently(well, quickly and without waste),for example, all of the workers must work at the same time. YCTherefore, they must know what time to start work in the morning and what time they may go home in the afternoon. Passengers must know the exact time that an airplane will arrive or depart. Students and teachers need to know when a class starts and ends. Stores must open on time in order to serve their customers. Complicated . societies need clocks and calendars. Thus, we can see that if each person worked according to his or her own schedule, a complicated society could hardly work at all. The Australian aborgines' way of""telling time""is based on_.",the change of the sun rays,the movement of the earth in relation to the sun,the position of the stone,the position of the tree or the cliff,A

The success of these suggestions depends upon your ability to use your child's natural desire to get involved in games he finds simple and fun. A good way to begin is to read aloud a sentence from a book suitable for your child's reading age. Then ask your youngster to repeat the sentence back to you correctly. Next, reread the sentence, leaving out a particular word. See if your child can identify the word you left out. At the beginning use only simple sentences. Gradually, increase the length of the sentences. Make sure you don't rush things along too quickly, or your child may become discouraged and tired of the game. Take your child shopping with you often. He's to remember a list of items you want to buy in the supermarket. First , ask him to remember only a few things. Then, as he shows increased ability to remember, make the list longer and longer. Praise him often and warmly when he shows increased ability to remember things. He'll become proud of his 'good' memory and will happily play the game. Encourage your child to learn easy and short poems. As his ability to do this becomes stronger, encourage him to remember longer poems. Do the same with songs.

But to understand how three quarters of the world's people live, and how their future might affect ours, I felt that I first had to try and share their way of life.In the end I chose a mountain village because it was a little cooler than those in the plains.

484,"Taxi, the underground, driving...in London these means of transport are expensive. As a student on a budget, I couldn't afford the 30 pounds (around 300 yuan) fare for a taxi. Even a bus was one pound and 20 pence (about 12 yuan) for a single ticket. I didn't need to travel this way anyway. I had Mabel-- my London bike.      When I moved to Beijing, like every foreigner, I was delighted to discover I could take a cab for cheaper than a single journey on the subway. But something was wrong. I missed Mabel. That was when I met Mandarin Mabel also known as Mandy, my Beijing bike.       In many ways, Beijing is made for: It is a flat, easy land compared with hilly London. The cycling city's north/south/east/west square structure is also easier to travel than London's unplanned, twisting streets.      However, Beijing comes completely with its own dangers. The rules of the road are flexible. Bikes, cars, passers-by all float up and down ways in both directions.      Compared with London's terrible cycle paths, in Beijing, every road has huge, wide cycle ways. But cars, taxis and motorbikes see no reason why they shouldn't use the cycle ways as a shortcut, and why they shouldn't announce you to get out of their way when they do.       Beijing traffic is more good-natured. In London, the road is an active war. People shout, quarrel and beat on each other's windows. In Beijing zone, drivers never get actively angry. In fact, often they ignore cyclists. Obviously that means it's up to the cyclists to see them.      Mandy is a tree Beijing bike. It is nearly broken, it makes loud noises every time you ride on it, and I have had to make several emergency repair stops for it.      But cycling round Beijing on a sunny day is a joy.

485,"It is well known that Albert Einstein was one of the greatest scientists of all time and he was also a really great person. Here are some interesting things about him. When Einstein started to work in America, someone asked him what he needed. He said he needed a desk, some paper and a pencil. He also asked for a big waste-paper basket to hold all of his mistakes. This shows that he knew even the cleverest man in the world can only learn by making mistakes. Einstein regarded time as very important. He never wore socks and he thought putting on socks was a waste of time as people already wore shoes. He also thought it was a waste of time remembering things that could quickly be found in a book. That's why he never remembered his own phone number, which was in the phone book. He knew what was worth remembering. It is true that if we are going to do great things in our lives, we can not waste our time. Einstein liked to joke too.

Most of us would rather eat sweets and ice-cream than meat and rice. Sweets and ice-cream are not bad for the stomach if we eat them at the end of a meal. But we should also know that if we eat them before a meal, they will spoil   our appetite  . It is a good habit for us to eat our meal at the same time each day. When we feel hungry, it is a sign that our body needs a good supply. When we feel angry or excited, we may not want to eat. A long time ago, in England some judges used to decide whether a man was telling the truth by giving him some dry bread. If he could not swallow   the bread, it was a sign that he wasn't telling the truth. He was telling lies. Although this seems very strange and rather foolish, it is indeed an excellent way of finding out the truth. A man who is worrying about something has difficulty in swallowing anything dry.

Two 12-year-old boys, Christian and Jack, rowed out a boat to search for a football. Once they'd rowed beyond the calm waters, a beach umbrella tied to the boat caught the wind and pulled the boat into open water. The pair panicked and tried to row back to shore. But they were no match for it and the boat was out of control. Tim knew it would soon be swallowed by the waves. ""Everything went quiet in my head,"" Tim recalls  . ""I was trying to figure out how to swim to the boys in a straight line."" Tim took off his clothes and jumped into the water. Every 500 yards or so, he raised his head to judge his progress. ""At one point, I considered turning back,"" he says. ""I wondered if I was putting my life at risk."" After 30 minutes of struggling, he was close enough to yell to the boys, ""Take down the umbrella!""               Christian made much effort to take down the umbrella. Then Tim was able to catch up and climb aboard the boat. He took over rowing, but the waves were almost too strong for him. ""Let's aim for the pier  ,"" Jack said. Tim turned the boat toward it. Soon afterward, waves crashed over the boat, and it began to sink. ""Can you guys swim?"" he cried. ""A little bit,"" the boys said.

In fact, they are stealing your corporate secrets. Drive-by hacking is the trendy term given to the practice of breaking into wireless computer networks from outside the buildings that house them. A recent study in the UK, sponsored by RSA Data Security, found that two-thirds of organizations with wireless networks were risking their data in this way. Security experts patrolled   several streets in the City of London seeking evidence of wireless networks in operation. Of 124 that they identified, 83 were sending data without encrypting them. Such data could readily be picked up by a passer-by armed only with a portable computer, a wireless modem and a few pieces of software that can be freely downloaded from the Internet. The data could include sensitive company documents containing valuable information. Or they could be e-mail identities and passwords that could be used by hackers to log into corporate networks as if they were legal users. Most companies using wireless networking technology do not take even the simplest of measures to protect their data. Nearly all wireless network technology comes with some basic security features that need only to be activated   in order to give a minimum level of security, for example, by encrypting the data being passed over the network. Raymon Kruck, business development manager at Check Point Software, a security technology specialist, believes this could be partly a psychological problem. People see the solid walls of their building as safeguards and forget that wireless networks can extend up to 200 meters beyond physical walls. Companies without any security at all on their wireless networks make it ridiculously easy for hackers to break in. Switching on the security that comes with the network technology should be automatic. Then there are other basic steps a company can take, says Mr. Kruck, such as changing the passwords on the network from the default   setting. Companies can also install firewalls, which form a barrier between the internal network and the public Internet. They should also check their computer records regularly to spot any abnormal activity, which might betray the presence of a hacker.

The young girl had held too much anger and pain inside and she rebelled. She repeatedly ran away from home and got into various troubles. During that time, she turned heavy smoker, became addicted to alcohol and drug and was sent to a juvenile detention home  at the age of 13. Fed up, Oprah's mother sent her to Tennessee to live with her father. To a large extent, this man saved Oprah's life and helped pave the way for her success. She received a full scholarship to Tennessee State University where she majored in Speech and Performing Arts. After graduation, she landed a job as a news reader at a television station, where she did not do well at first. But she did not give up; instead, she worked harder. She put in long hours and prepared carefully before going on camera. Her hard work paid off: she moved up swiftly to news reader and reporter in Baltimore and was offered her own talk show in 1977.

495,"Gallows humor  may seem like a mistake, or at least in poor taste. But psychologists say that gallows humor can be an important way to relieve stress.""Humor makes you feel in control and it can give you that feeling that everything is okay even when it's not,""says James M.Jones, a psychology professor at the University of Delaware. Psychologists say that just because you're laughing doesn't mean you're wasting time. Occasional tease among colleagues, particularly if it is associated with the job, can inspire creativity, departmental cohesiveness  and performance. ""There are a lot of stresses out there,""says Ed Dunkelblau, a psychologist in Chicago.""Gallows humor is a way of making difficult things a little less difficult."" This is as long as the humor is used for the right purpose. The main point of it should be inspiring people--not laughing at them. ""Anything that would lift morale  in terms of the company would be good humor,""says Thierry Guedj, a professor. You want to give your employees and co-workers a sense of belonging, so don't make observations that are aggressive. Most obviously, Dr. Guedj says, don't make comments about people's physical appearance or faith. If you have any doubt about its appropriateness, don't go through with it. Or you can take aim at the person that you know won't be offended : yourself. ""If there's going to be a joke or story, it should be you,""Mr Dunkelblau says. ""People with the ability to laugh at themselves can give other people permission to laugh at themselves, too,""Mr Jones says.""And if you can laugh at yourself, you feel better about yourself."" What can we infer from the passage?",People tend to laugh at others rather than themselves.,Laughing at yourself can make others free from stress.,People can't avoid offending others with gallows humor.,People who laugh at themselves are easy to gain others' permission.,B
496,"When you are curious about something, and want to know more about it, you can use the way of asking questions. Asking questions is the first step to make discoveries and find interesting answers. The steps below can guide you during the research. Step 1 On a note card or piece of paper,write down the subject that you are interested in. Just get the main idea down. For example, you might write: Discover more about dinosaurs. Step 2 Next, stop and think for a moment about what you already know about your subject. List what you already know like the sentences below: (1)Dinosaurs lived long before human beings appeared. (2)Dinosaurs lived on the earth for more than 150 million years. (3)Some dinosaurs fed on plants, some on meat. Step 3 What can you do with what you want to learn? By asking questions. On your paper,start writing down questions about the dinosaurs as you think of them: (1)What's the best weather for dinosaurs to live in? (2)How many kinds of dinosaurs are there? (3)Have dinosaurs really disappeared? Step 4 Armed with your list of questions, you can now go to the nearest library or computer to begin your research. As you learn more about your subject, you'll probably discover some new questions. For example,you might discover that dinosaurs disappeared about 65 million years ago. Why?What happened?Asking new questions can help you research your subject more widely. The next time you find something interesting to research,take time to organize your thinking by asking good questions. And remember--learning more always bring more questions.

497,"Plants can't communicate by moving or making sounds, as most animals do. Instead, plants produce volatile compounds   ---- chemicals that easily change from a liquid to a gas. A flower's sweet smell, for example, comes from such volatile compounds to attract insects such as bugs and bees. Plants can also discover  volatile compounds produced by other plants. A tree under attack by hungry insets, for instance, may give off these chemicals in order to let other trees know about the attack. In response, the other trees may send off their chemicals to keep the bugs away ---- or even chemicals that will attract the bugs' natural enemies. Now scientists have created a quick way to understand what plants are saying: a chemical sensor   called an ""electronic nose"". The ""e-nose"" can tell such compounds as plants make. When plants are attacked, scientists say, the e-nose could help quickly decide whether plants are being eaten by insects. But today, the only way to spot such insects is to inspect individual plants by observing them. This is a challenging task for managers of greenhouses, including those that can house thousands of plants. The research team is working with an e-nose that can recognize volatile compounds. Inside the device, 13 sensors chemically react with volatile compounds based on the interactions  , and then the e-nose will give off electronic signals that the scientists can analyze by using computer software. To test the e-nose, the team presented it with healthy leaves from cucumber, pepper and tomato plants, all being common greenhouse crops. Then scientists collected samples of the air around damaged leaves from each type of crop. These plants had been damaged either by insects or by scientists who made holes in the leaves with a hole punch  . The e-nose, it turns out, can identify healthy cucumber, pepper and tomato plants based on the volatile compounds they produce. It could also identify tomato leaves that had been damaged. But even more impressive, the device could tell which type of damage ---- by insects or with a hole punch ---- had been done to the tomato leaves. With some fine-tuning  , a device like the e-nose can one day be used in greenhouses to quickly spot harmful bugs, the researchers say. A device like this can also be used to identify fruits that are perfectly ripe and ready to pick and eat, says Natalia Dudareva, a biochemist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, India, who studies smells of flowers and plants. Hopefully, scientists believe, the device can bring large benefits to greenhouse managers in the near future. According to the writer, the most amazing thing about the e-nose is that it can    _   .",pick out ripe fruits quite expertly,spot the insects in a very quick way,tell different damages to leaves,recognize unhealthy tomato leaves,C

499,"Do you blank out or feel so nervous in exams that you have trouble writing answers to questions that you knew just last night? If so, you likely have a case of test anxiety. But, don't be afraid. By recognizing the problem, you are taking the first step towards overcoming it. Believe it or not, a touch of nervousness can sharpen your mind, allowing you to perform more quickly. This is because under stress, the body releases   the hormone adrenaline  , which prepares it for something important that will happen. However, too much anxiety can result in sleeplessness, loss of appetite before tests, and poor performance. Some people might feel hot and tired. With great anger they often shout or complain for no reason. If you worry a lot or are a perfectionist, you are more likely to have trouble with test anxiety. Those who have prepared poorly for a test or have had negative experiences taking tests may also experience test anxiety. When you feel a storm of anxiety coming on, stop what you're doing and make your mind a blank. If possible, actually tell yourself to 'STOP!' This will get your mind off the stress. Then think of being at a place of comfort and let your body relax. As you continue the test, find questions you know the answers to and answer them first. This will help restore your confidence. Important of all, talk to yourself using positive language. Make it a habit to replace each negative thought with a logical reason. For example: ""I've studied hard and I know the material, so I'm ready to do the best I can."" Another thing you can do is to learn to accept mistakes. In fact, they can be valuable learning opportunities. Last but not least, start test preparation early - three to five days ahead of the quiz or test. After all, good study habits and skills - for example, time management and note-taking - will give you the feeling that you are in control.

""Let me tell you something, Tom, something that has helped me keep a good perspective on my own priorities  ."" He continued, ""You see, I sat down one day and did a little math. The average person lives for about seventy-five years. Now then, I multiplied 75 by 52 and I came up with 3,900 which is the number of Saturdays that the average person has in their entire lifetime. Now stick with (......) me, Tom. I'm getting to the important part."" ""It wasn't until I had lived through over twenty-eight hundred Saturdays that I started thinking about all this in any detail,"" he went on. ""I got to thinking that if I lived to be seventy-five, I only had about a thousand of them left to enjoy. So I went to a toy store and bought 1,000 marbles. I took them home and put them inside a large, clear plastic container. Every Saturday since then, I have taken one marble out and thrown it away. ""I found that by watching the marbles diminish  , I focused more on the really important things in life. There is nothing like watching your time here on this earth run out to help get your priorities straight. ""It was nice to meet you, Tom.

501,"All schoolchildren should have ""happiness"" lessons up to the age of 18 to combat growing levels of depression, according to a senior government adviser. ""Pupils should study subjects such as how to manage feelings, attitudes to work and money, channeling   negative emotions and even how to take a critical view of the media,"" said Lord Richard Layard, a Labor peer and professor of economics at the London School of Economics. The proposal comes only days after the Government said that lessons in manners--including respect for the elderly and how to say ""please"" and ""thank you""--should be taught in secondary schools to combat bad behavior. Lord Layard, the director of the wellbeing program at the LSE's Center for Economic Performance, said: ""Learning hard things takes an enormous amount of practice. To play the violin well takes 10,000 hours of practice. How can we expect people to learn to be happy without large amounts of practice and repetition?"" It is believed that at least two percent of British children under 12 now struggle with significant depression. Among teenagers, the figure rises to five percent. A UNICEF study involving 21 developed countries showed that British children were the least satisfied with their lives, while the World Health Organization predicts that childhood psychiatric   disorders will rise by 50 percent by 2020. In a speech at Cambridge University, Lord Layard said the Government's lessons in manners did not go far enough. ""We need a commitment to producing a major specialism in this area, with a serious teacher training program,"" he said. However, happiness lessons have been criticized by academics. Frank Furedi, a sociology professor at Kent University and author of Therapy Culture, said: ""In pushing emotional literacy, what some teachers are really doing is abandoning teaching. They are giving up and talking about emotions instead, so that children value all this non-discipline-led activity more than maths, English or science.

502,"When your parents advise you to ""get an education"" in order to raise your income, they tell you only half the truth. What they really mean is to get just enough education to provide manpower  for your society, but not so much that you prove an embarrassment to your society. Get a high school diploma, at least. Without that, you will be occupationally dead unless your name happens to be George Bernard Shaw or Thomas Alva Edison, and you can successfully dropout in grade school. Get a college degree, if possible. With a B. A., you are on the launching pad. But now you have to start to put on the brakes. If you go for a master's degree, make sure it is an M.B.A., and the famous law of diminishing  returns begins to take effect. Do you know, for instance, that long-haul truck drivers earn more per year than full professors? Yes, the average salary for those truckers was $24000 while the full professors managed to earn just $23030. A doctorate is the highest degree you can get. Except for a few specialized fields such as physics or chemistry where the degree can quickly be turned to industrial or commercial purposes, if you pursue such a degree in any other field, you will face a future which is not bright. There are more doctors unemployed or underemployed in this country than any other part of the world. If you become a doctor in English or history or anthropology or political science or languages or--worst of all--in philosophy, you run the risk of becoming overeducated for our national demands. Not for our needs, mind you, but for our demands. Thousands of doctors are selling shoes, driving cars, waiting on table, and endlessly filling out applications month after month. They may also take a job in some high school or backwater  college that pays much less than the doorkeeper earns. You can equate the level of income with the level of education only so far. Far enough, that is, to make you useful to the gross national product, but not so far that nobody can turn much of a profit on you. Which of the following is NOT true?","Bernard Shaw didn't finish high school, nor did Edison.",One must think carefully before pursuing a master's degree.,"The higher your education level, the more money you will earn.","If you are too well-educated, you'll be overeducated for society's demands.",C
503,"I have been teaching animal behavior at the Boulder County Prison in Colorado for 10 years. The course is one of the most popular in the prison. Prisoners have to earn the right to attend the course and they work hard to get in. One reason why the course is so popular is that many prisoners find it easier to connect with animals than with people, because animals don't judge them. They trust animals in ways they don't with humans. Yet, they hold a misunderstanding of how animals treat one another. Many admit that their own ""animal behavior"" is what got them into trouble in the first place. I teach that though there is competition and aggression in the animal kingdom, there is also a lot of cooperation and sympathy. Many of the students want to build healthy relationships, and they find that the class helps them. I use examples of the social behavior of group-living animals such as wolves as a model for developing and maintaining friendships among people who must work together for their own good and also for the good of the group. It's clear that science inspires the students here and it also gives them hope. I know some students have gone back into education after their being set free while others have gone to work for humane societies or contributed time and money to conservation organizations. One went on to receive a master's degree in nature writing. Science and humane education help the prisoners connect with values that they otherwise would not have done. It opens the door to understanding, trust, cooperation and hope. There's a large population of people to whom science could mean a lot, if only they could have access to it. The class helps me, too. I get as much out of it as the students and it has made me a better teacher.

At present, China's largest web portal Sina claims to have 5,000 company micro-blog users, including Starbucks, Channel, and IKEA. On the micro-blog pages of the companies, visitors can not only view advertisements, but also see consumer feedback   and even commentaries on hot social issues.

Huang Heshui, professor from Xiamen University says micro-blogging is highly personal and private, and that too many advertising messages can annoy micro-blog users leading them to dislike certain brands. Further, a brand can be as easily damaged as established through micro-blogging, as consumers' negative feedback about a certain product or company can be very quickly spread in the micro-blog community, Huang added.

According to rising evidence, climate changewon't just cause new cases of stress, anxiety and depression. People who already have serious psychological problems will probably suffer most in the result of natural disasters and extreme weather events. ""When these events happen, people with pre-established mental illnesses often have more extreme difficulty,"" said Lisa Page, a psychiatrist. ""This is an area we maybe need to think about a little more seriously.""  In public health circles and even in climate talks, scientists have studied how climate change might affect physical health, by for example, causing the spread of malaria, fever and other infectious diseases.  For the most part, though, the experts have made only vague references to the link between climate change and mental health, even though evidence for such connections is starting to pile up. In the future, climate models predict more destructive storms, floods, droughts and diseases. In turn, the new study suggests, more psychological crises will follow.  Heat waves -- like the one that killed some 70,000 people in Europe in the summer of 2003 -- will also happen more frequently, last longer and be severer in coming years. The mentally ill will be hardest hit by these events because they're more likely to live in poor housing without air conditioning.  People with pre-existing mental challenges will probably also have an extra hard time dealing with other forecasted consequences of climate change, including the sinking of coastlines and mass migration away from flooded shores.

A study found that men and women who frequently used several types of technology at the same time had less grey matter in a key part of the brain. University of Sussex researchers said, ""Simultaneously using mobile phones, laptops and other media devices could be changing the structure of our brains."" The finding follows research which has linked multi-tasking with a shortened attention span, depression, anxiety and lower grades at school. The researchers began by asking 75 healthy men and women how often they divided their attention between different types of technology. This could mean sending a text message while listening to music and checking email, or speaking on the phone while watching TV and surfing the web. The volunteers were then given brain scans which showed they had less grey matter in a region called the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The findings held even when differences in personality were taken into account. The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, is the first to make a link between multi-tasking and the structure of the brain. Researcher Kep Kee Loh said, ""Media multi-tasking is becoming more common in our lives today and there is increasing concern about its impacts on our cognition and social-emotional well-being."" He added that more research is needed to prove that multi-tasking shrinks the brain. This is because it is also possible that people with less grey matter in the ACC are more drawn to using lots of small devices simultaneously. Scientists have previously demonstrated brain structure can be changed on prolonged exposure to new environments and experience. Other studies have shown that training -- such as learning to juggle or taxi drivers learning the map of London -- can increase grey-matter densities   in certain parts. Experts have also warned of the harmful impact technology can have on our memory and attention span.

516,"The deep sea is one of the most mysterious places on earth. Scientists rarely go there. Those few do discover new species all of the time. Many places of the deepest parts of the ocean, where it's forever dark, can light up. Now, a teen's research has shown new light on how one of these swimming animals behaves in darkness. The giant flashlight fish lives in the Indian Ocean as well as in tropical parts of the central and western Pacific. It lives at depths of up to 400 meters, (about 1,300 feet). But not always. Sometimes it lives in coral reefs in shallow waters. In those shallow waters, the blackish-blue fish comes out only at night. Reef-dwelling members of this species tend to be smaller than those living in deeper waters. Those biggies can grow to lengths of 35meters (14inches). That may not sound like a giant, but they are the largest of their type of fish. The giant flashlight fish gets its name from a small glow-in-the-dark patch found in a packet of tissue under each eye, explains Caroline Edmonds. She is a 13- year-old student from Fountain Valley, Calif. There, she attends Talbert Middle School. She said that the eye pockets in these fish contain light-producing bacteria. These bacteria and their host fish have built a relationship that helps both. The fish use the bacteria as a way to communicate with creatures around them. The bacteria gain nutrients from the fish and a safe place to live. When a fish wants to "" flash"" its light, it turns the bacteria-filled pocket toward the outside of its body, Caroline explains. When a fish wants to hide its light, it turns the pocket back toward the inside. According to her data, the fish flash most often when they are being fed. They flash least often late at night, when they are resting. What do we know about the giant flashlight fish?",It doesn't like living in warm places.,It can be found in coral reefs at times.,It doesn't like moving around at night.,It always lives at depths of up to 400 meters.,B

518,"Do you want to love what you do for a living? Follow your passion. This piece of advice provides the foundation for modern thinking on career satisfaction. But this can be a problem. I've spent the past several years researching and writing about the different strategies we use to seek happiness in our work. It became clear early in the process that the suggestion to ""follow your passion"" was flawed  , for it lacks scientific evidence. However, it doesn't mean you should abandon the goal of feeling passionate about your work. The reality emphasizes that things are quite complicated. Passion is earned. Different people are looking for different things in their work, but generally, people with satisfying careers enjoy some combination of the following features: autonomy,respect, competence, creativity, and a sense of impact. In other words,if you want to feel passionate about your livelihood,don't seek the perfect job,but seek to get more of these features in the job you already have. Passion is elusive  . Many people develop the rare and valuable skills leading to passion, but still end up unhappy in their work. The problem is that the features leading you to love your work are more likely to be useful to you than your organization. As you become increasingly ""valuable"",for example, your boss might push you toward traditional promotions that come with more pay and more responsibility, as this is what is most useful to your company. However, you might find more passion by applying your value to gain autonomy in your schedule or project selection. Passion is dangerous. I've watched too many of my peers fall into anxiety and chronic  job-hopping   due to the ""follow your passion"" advice. The issue is expectations. _  Work is hard. Not every day is fun. If you're seeking a dream job, you'll end up frustrated, again and again. Don't set out to discover passion. Instead, set out to develop it. This path might be longer and more complicated than what most cheerful career guides might advocate, but it's a path much more likely to lead you somewhere worth going. What's the author's attitude towards the advice of ""following your passion""?",Disapproving.,Supportive.,Cautious.,Unclear.,A

520,"""Find a job you love, and you'll never work a day in your life."" Do you agree with this old saying? Joanne Gordon does. She is the author of Be Happy at work and other books about careers . Gordon believes that about 30% of employees  in North America do not like their jobs, and she thinks that is terrible. She wants to help people who do not feel satisfied with their jobs find work that is good for them. Joanne says, ""There are no happy jobs, only happy workers."" She believes that happy workers share three main characteristics. First, happy workers enjoy the daily activities of their jobs, and they look forward to the workday. Take Tony Hawk, for example. At age 14, he became a professional skateboarder. Now he is a businessman working on projects related to skateboarding--films and video games, but he still skates every day. He once said, ""My youngest son's pre-school was recently asked what their dads do for work. My son said, 'I've never seen my dad do work.'"" Tony agrees that his job doesn't look like work. He has found a way to spend each day doing a job he enjoys. Second, happy workers like the people they work with. Sally Ayote says, ""I work with the coolest people in the world."" She and her group cook for almost 1,200 people in Antarctica. Most of these people are scientists who are doing research. Sally loves to sit and talk with them. She says, ""There is no television here, no radio, so I get to know the scientists and what they're studying."" Sally thinks she has a great job, and the best part about it is the people. Third, happy workers know that their work helps others. Caroline Baron's work helps people who have had to leave their home countries because of war or other dangers. She is a filmmaker who started an organization called FilmAid, which shows movies in refugee  camps around the world. Caroline believes that movies can be very helpful in these camps. For one thing, entertaining movies let refugees forget their troubles for a little while. Movies can also teach important subjects like health and safety. For example, in one camp, thousands of refugees saw a movie about how to get clean water. Caroline knows that is helping other people, and this makes her feel proud and happy about her work. Tony Hawk, Sally Ayote, and Caroline Baron all get great satisfaction from their work. Tony Hawk says, ""Find the thing you love. If you are doing what you love, there is much more happiness there than being rich or famous."" Joanne Gordon would agree. She encourages people to find something they enjoy doing, find people they like to work with, and find ways to help others. Then they can be proud of what they do, and they will probably be happy at work. Tony Hawk, Sally Ayote, and Caroline Baron are good examples that show us   _  .",how to be a successful businessman,how to help people in difficulties,how to get along with the coolest people,how to become a happy worker,D

After one month of my marriage, I started working because I could not sit home. To accomplish our dreams, we are both working hard day and night in spite of belonging to a good family. Life is very strange. When any turn happens, one cannot know. I started working because I was very ambitious. I used to wonder about people who worked to earn their bread but I never knew in my wildest dreams that I would be part of the crowd who work to earn a livelihood. I was blessed with a daughter in November, 2009. She was just three months and 15 days old when I rejoined my job. My husband supported me and my family supported me but I never wanted to work again because I belonged to a family where a mother should give her full attention to her child.

522,"One day King Solomon decided to  _ Benaiah Ben Yehoyada, his most trusted minister. He said to him, ""Benaiah, there is a certain ring that I want you to bring to me. I wish to wear it for Sukkot   which gives you six months to find it.""     ""If it exists anywhere on earth, your majesty,"" replied Benaiah, ""I will find it and bring it to you, but what makes the ring so special?""     ""It has magic powers,"" answered the king. ""If a happy man looks at it, he becomes sad, and if a sad man looks at it, he becomes happy."" Solomon knew that no such ring existed in the world, but he wished to give his minister a little taste of modesty. Spring passed and then summer, and still Benaiah had no idea where he could find the ring. On the night before Sukkot, he decided to take a walk in one of the poorest quarters of Jerusalem. He passed by a merchant who had begun to set out the day's goods on a shabby carpet.     ""Have you by any chance heard of a magic ring that makes the happy wearer forget his joy and the broken-hearted wearer forget his sorrows?"" asked Benaiah. He watched the grandfather take a plain gold ring from his carpet and carve something on it. When Benaiah read the words on the ring, his face broke out in a wide smile. That night the entire city welcomed in the holiday of Sukkot with great festivity.     ""Well, my friend,"" said Solomon, ""have you found what I sent you after?"" All the ministers laughed and Solomon himself smiled. To everyone's surprise, Benaiah held up a small gold ring and declared, ""Here it is, your majesty!"" As soon as Solomon read the inscription, the smile disappeared from his face. The jeweler had written three Hebrew letters on the gold band: ""gimel, zayin, yod"", which began the words ""Gam zeh ya'avor"" --  _ At that moment Solomon realized that all his wisdom and wealth and great power were but fleeting things, for one day he would be nothing but dust.

525,"In the English language, there are many expressions using the word ""mouth"". For example, if you say bad things about a person, the person might protest  and say ""Do not bad mouth me.""     Sometimes, people say something to a friend or family member that they later regret because it hurts that person's feelings. Or they tell the person something they were not supposed to tell. The speaker might say :""I really put my foot in my mouth this time."" If this should happen, the speaker might feel down in the mouth.   In other words, he might feel sad for saying the wrong thing.     Information is often spread through word of mouth. This is general communication between people, like friends talking to each other. ""How did you hear about that new movie?"" someone might ask. ""Oh, by word of mouth.""     Sometimes when one person is speaking ,he says the same thing that his friend was going to say . When this happens, the friend might say ""You took the words right out of my mouth."" Sometimes a person has a bad or unpleasant experience with another person ,he might say ""I had my heart in my mouth.""     Some people have lots of money because they were born into a very rich family. You might say such a person ""was born with a silver spoon in his mouth ."" This rich person is the opposite of a person who lives from hand to mouth. This person is very poor and only has enough money for the most important things in life.    Parents might sometimes keep sweet food from a child ad punishment for saying bad things,  For example , if a child says things she should not say to her parents , she might be described as a mouthy child.

528,"Beliefs form a big part of our lives. Successful people have always believed that they can be and will be successful in their lives, such as Michael Phelps. Many of us have seen Michael Phelps win 8 gold medals in a single Olympic Games. That has created a history for himself. Many people have admired his success and the first reaction in their mind will be, ""Wow, how I wish I could be like him!"" Have you ever wondered what brought him success? In fact, anyone can achieve what they have wanted to achieve. It is about beliefs. Everyone is a born winner. It is this belief that drives an individual to be successful in his or her own field. All successful individuals have strong beliefs and it is one of the bases for their success. If we start to believe in ourselves, the things that we can achieve will definitely give us a pleasant surprise. Other than having a strong belief, it is the attitude that drives the individual to create their own history. The devotion towards themselves and the drive must also be present. Imagine having a strong belief in oneself and having a poor attitude towards life. Then how would that individual turn out to be? One's attitude _ the drive, the devotion and the desire to achieve his goals. If one has strong beliefs about the goals that he can achieve and he displays good attitudes towards them, it would be no surprise to anyone that he will be able to achieve his goals.

Since its beginning in 1980, the Edmonton Folk Music Festival has been commemorating  the true feeling of what folk music is all about and that's the traditional togetherness  that is felt when people gather to share stories and feelings through song. This year will be the sixth year when volunteer Riedel will be offering up her time to the festival. ""People coming off a busy spring and summer have a moment of relaxation,"" Riedel said. ""It's really easy to relax, and it's great seeing family and friends have fun together."" These families and friends come from all different kinds of musical tastes.

There are free water stations throughout the venue  for people to fill up their travel cups. When people buy food, reusable dishes are given a $2 plate fee, but that is returned when the plate is brought back. The festival has completely sold out of tickets, and in record time. But with big names such as Van Morrison and Jakob Dylan, it's easy to see how that was going to happen. There is no parking area during the festival, so using the Park & Ride system or Edmonton Transit is highly recommended.

Thanks to modern methods of transport, we can travel everywhere more easily and more quickly than ever before, but the language problem still remains. Without a common language, there may be misunderstandings between people of different countries. There are two possible solutions to this problem: either we choose one of the main living languages of the world, or we make up an artificial  one. But neither solution is simple because no living language will be acceptable to everyone and because an artificial language, such as Esperanto, has no culture and would be thought boring by many learners. It is often said that English is quickly becoming a world language. It is certainly the most widely used language in the world, and second only to Chinese in its number or native speakers, but there are certain worries of choosing English as an international language. First of all, for political reasons and national pride, English is not acceptable to everyone as a world language. Many dislike its influence. English words enter their language and this often threats their own language. In France, a new word ""frangla is"" has been invented to describe the results.

He came to the old man and said, 'Will you please show me your ticket?' The old man looked for his ticket in all his pockets, but he could not find it. He was very worried. 'I can't find my ticket. I really bought a ticket before I got on the train.' said the old man. 'I believe you bought a ticket. All right, you don''t have to buy another one, ' said the conductor kindly.

539,"A graded reader is a book containing simplified languages used to help learners master the language. Readers come in different levels, from beginners to advanced. English learners need to choose a reader that is suitable for their level. Why use readers? Lots of research shows that extensive reading improves all aspects of language learning, including vocabulary, speaking skills, fluency ,writing skills and reading comprehension. prefix = st1 /Reading is a way of learning English without classes or a teacher. It helps develop learner independence. And while reading graded readers, learners don't have to run to a dictionary because the language is at their level. How do I get started? The entire class can read the same book or different books at different times. How do I know the right level? If your class is all reading the same book, choose one that is appropriate for their level. If your students are reading different books, you can have a selection of books at different levels. In this case, don't worry too much about the level. A learner who is interested in detective stories might read a higher level book if the motivation is there. How to read the book depends on students' age, motivation and class time available. Some classes like to read silently, others like to read aloud in small groups and some enjoy being read to by the teacher. Be sensitive to the class and ask for their opinions. Some pre-reading activities are needed. Before students open a book, it is important to spark interest in the story and in the whole process of reading. For example, ask them to guess what the story is from cover, chapter titles and let students put them in the best order, or discuss the author. During reading, choose a suitable chapter or chapters that can be broken down to make a comic strip  . Or students select a part of the book to make into a radio play. Students can also become journalists and report on parts of the story. Choose a piece of action and have students write it up. Besides, students can role-play an interview with a character. From the passage, we can learn that_.",readers can make classroom fun,reading can help develop learners dependence,some pre-reading activities are not needed,extensive reading improves all aspects of language learning,D

542,"Read the following three passages. Each passage is followed by several questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C and D. Choose the one that fits best according to the information given in the passage. Britons stranded at sea or in flooded homes could find a real-life prince riding to their rescue. Prince William announced on Monday that he is to train to be a full-time pilot with the Royal Air Force's Search and Rescue Force (SARF). William, who is currently a Lieutenant in the Army's Household Cavalry Regiment , will transfer to the RAF and begin an 18-month training course in January 2009. If successful, he will become a fully operational Search and Rescue pilot in 2010, flying Sea King helicopters at one of the six SARF units based in Britain. ""The time I spent with the RAF earlier this year made me realize how much I love flying,"" the prince, who spent two weeks with a SARF team while on work experience in 2005, said in a statement. ""Joining Search and Rescue is a perfect opportunity for me to serve in the Forces operationally, while contributing to a vital part of the country's Emergency Services."" It means he will follow a similar career to that of his uncle, Prince Andrew, who was a Sea King helicopter pilot during the 1982 Falklands war. The Search and Rescue teams' main duty is to recover RAF personnel but in peacetime they mainly respond to civilian emergencies, dealing with more than 1,000 calls a year. The units deal with incidents ranging from helping those trapped by sudden major floods to rescuing people lost while out walking on hills. William, who has spent the last year on secondment to the various branches of the military to prepare for his future role as head of the armed forces, received his RAF wings  following a four-month stint with the service earlier this year. However, his time with the RAF was clouded when the Defense Ministry was forced to fend off criticism for allowing the prince to fly military helicopters to a bachelor party for his cousin and to the family home of his girlfriend Kate Middleton. It can be inferred from the passage that  _  .",the RAF is an army that rescues its soldiers during wartime,either Andrew or William is interested in flying,there are many floods happening in Britain,the prince saving the people in danger is no longer fairy tale,B
543,"You may never think a documentary film could have aroused so much public enthusiasm in Chinese history. Nowadays everybody is talking about a new 7-part documentary called A Bite of China which was recently broadcast late at night on CCTV I. The documentary describes various _ across the vast Chinese culinary landscape. According to Taobao, China's biggest online retail website, just five days after the series began to air, nearly 6 million people went to the site in search of various local specialties, particularly those mentioned in the documentary. More than 7.2 million deals were concluded. A ham producer from Yunnan Province saw his sales grow 17-fold in five days. However, one can't help but believe that the documentary's popularity is probably linked to the endless stream of terrible food security issues that have emerged in recent years. In one well-received article, a netizen wrote, ""I wonder how many felt so empty-hearted and sighed after watching the film. Blue-vitriol watered chive, formaldehyde sprayed cabbage, Sudan Red colored salty eggs, restaurants using gutter oil. The list is long..."" How will a varied and ancient food culture that is famous worldwide and which should have made the Chinese proud end? Food is the most vital thing in people's lives. Yet China's food industry has made people a little worried due to some severe food safety crisis. The market is huge while the cost of faking and cheating is so low for immoral businessmen; and the punishment is too light. Take the milk industry as an example. Although Sanlu, the company that sold the melamine-adulterated milk powder, was punished, thousands of other dairies didn't work hard to improve the quality. Therefore, food safety problems should be an important concern of Chinese government so that our ancient food culture can be preserved. As the documentary shows, people are attracted not to gourmet items like matsutake, a species of rare mushroom grown naturally in remote forests, but to common Chinese dishes like barley, lotus root or tofu. They are what meet our basic needs. This explains why people are so excited about A Bite of China---it is a reminder that there is still a world out there where food is excellent and safe. According to the passage, China's food industry has a problem of faking and cheating because  _  .",there are still so many poor people at the present time,the punishment for unscrupulous businessmen isn't serious enough,the Chinese government encourages it to do so,the food technology is not so advanced as in developing countries,B

548,"What kind of job do you want to do in the future ? One that earns the most money or one that gives you the highest social position? What about a job that makes you feel happy? Surprisingly, these three things do not always go together in the job world . According to a general social survey by the National Organization for Research at the University of Chicago in the US, the ten happiest jobs are not those with better pay or higher social position. They are ordinary jobs. But what is it that makes a ""happy"" job? Researchers found that people are happier when they feel they are doing something worthwhile. Six of the top ten happiest jobs are based heavily on helping others, such as firefighters, teachers, and physical therapists( ). Being able to express oneself is also important for people to feel satisfied . Take authors as an example. Their pay is ""ridiculously low or non-existent"", but ""the freedom of writing down the contents of your own mind leads to happiness ,""wrote business author Steve Denning on his blog on Forbes.com. These jobs are greatly different to the top ten ""hated jobs"", according a website survey earlier this year. Director of information technology, sales manager, technical specialist and others that are generally considered respectable jobs are on the list. Todd May from The New York Times didn't find the results strange. He argued that "" a meaningful life must, in some sense then , make people feel worthwhile"". If a person doesn't participate in the causes "" that are generally regarded as worthy, like feeding and clothing the poor, their life will lack meaning ,""he said . Work takes up the greater part of most people's  lives . It's no wonder that the people with the most worthwhile jobs are the happiest of all. However, it's important to remember that these two surveys are broad ones and that it doesn't matter whether your dream job is on the two lists. Now it is the time to think about the future .

549,"I have always really loved receiving my monthly pocket money form my dad. After getting the money I would be very excited and would rush off to my friend's place where after much consideration we would decide what to do with it and where to spend it. Mostly it would go for the ice cream treats(;) or jam sessions with our favorite people around. Girls will manage to find some way of budgeting so the money we save can be used for other purposes. I think that the best way to enjoy your pocket money would be to enjoy those treats that come occasionally. Since just mere pocket money would be not enough, many girls are doing a part time job of some form so that a larger amount of money can be collected. The best use of pocket money is to spend it in such a way that it involves lots of fun with your closest friends. Those treats are no fun if done alone. Company, especially good company can work wonders for providing you the best relaxation that you need. It is also best to spend your pocket money on things that otherwise parents end up refusing. When you use your pocket money to get this sense of achievement you will just feel so crazily happy. I remember the time when a friend and I were just so tired of our everyday _ life that we decided to go out, have some great food and then head out to the beach and have those lovely grape and mango ice-creams. And we did exactly that. That day has just been one of the most refreshing days of my life. I think the true meaning of pocket money is to be able to maximize your fun at a minimal cost!

""If somebody wants something of yours, you will be treated as warmly as spring, but if they don't you may be treated as coldly as winter."" You may consider this an exaggeration  , but if you are a salesman, it is clearly correct. You would never have found it to be so true if you hadn't been a salesman. You needn't stand doubtful looks and unfriendly comments; you needn't listen to something completely wrong and nod to say that it was quite right, you needn't worry about being refused time after time; you needn't always keep patience and a smile; you needn't repeat the same sentences over and over again; you needn't talk to somebody you dislike .... I did this work for a month, then I decided to give it up; Apart from the reasons above, I found I was paying too much attention to the job and thus sacrificing my study time. The latest test result proved that my grades were getting worse. Even worse, I hadn't enough time to join my classmates in college activities. Some times 1 felt lonely and unhappy because of both my study and my part-time job. Now I don't think it is worth doing such a thing for even though I was earning money it came at great cost. Newspapers and magazines often publish stories about excellent students who do part-time work while also keeping high scores in class. But according to my experience, park-time work can have some strong negative influences on study. Most students don't view the relationship between study and work correctly. In my opinion, if it isn't a must for financial reasons, students should be careful about taking up a part-time job.

As it turned out, the experience I got at the hospital taught me the opposite: my future was not in vet medicine. However, there is one particular Saturday morning that taught me something maybe more important. The hospital was in the middle of one of the poorer sections of the city and we often had people come in who could just only pay for the most basic treatments. This Saturday a man and his young son, who was probably about 7 years old, walked in with a small cat in a cardboard box. I remember the cat had an eye infection   but the man could not afford to pay for the cost of the medicine in addition to the exam. When he asked where the nearest the animal shelter  was, his son cried and started to argue with his father. _ an older woman who was sitting in the waiting room stood up, walked up to the counter, and told the man that she would pay for anything that he could not afford. The man thanked her and the son got to keep a healthy cat. I had always thought it was the right thing to help out a needy person, but it was only seen on TV or in movies. The woman in the vet's office taught me that these things do happen in real life, and should happen more often.

But the brave nurse went to work. Florence used her own money and some from friends to buy clothes, beds, medicine and food for the men. Her only pay was in smiles from the lips of dying soldiers. But they were more than enough for this kind woman. After she returned to England, she was honored for her services by Queen Victoria. But Florence said that her work had just begun. She raised money to build the Nightingale Home for Nurses in London. She also wrote a book on public health, which was printed in several countries.

The scientists say that the human body has changed very little since human first appeared on the earth,but the way we live has changed greatly. Our body has not been able to deal with these changes in lifestyles and this has led to new kinds of sicknesses. These new sicknesses were not known in ancient times. So they are called ""diseases of civilization "".Many cancers and diseases of the blood system,including heart attacks and strokes are examples of such diseases. Scientists noted  that early stoneage people used very little alcohol  or tobacco ,probably none. Ancient people also got a great deal of physical exercise,but a change in food is one of the main differences between life in ancient times and life today. Stoneage people hunted wild animals for their meat ,which had much less fat than farm animals. They also ate a lot of fresh wild vegetables and fruits. They did not use milk and other dairy products ,and they made very little use of grains . But today,we eat a large amount of dairy products and grain foods. We eat six times more salt than stoneage people. We eat more sugar. We eat twice as much fat but only one third as much protein and much less vitamin C.

Forensic  scientists work with the police to find quite small clues to catch criminals. Scientists work in schools and colleges as the teachers and professors who will train tomorrow's scientists. Don't think a scientist is far away! Maybe you like cooking? You could be a food technologist helping to keep fruit and vegetables fresher for longer. Perhaps sport is your thing? Do you know that most top athletes work with sports scientists in order to improve their performance? You could even be the science writer who gets to spend the life studying the latest advances and sharing them with the world. Looking for something to do for the rest of your life? My advice?

559,"One billion teenagers and young adults around the world are in the face of losing their hearing by listening to loud music. This is according to the World Health Organization. Few things can make people happy and full of energy like good music. Many people believe louder is better if you are listening to rock and roll. But if you really listen to the music loudly, even really good music, it can hurt your hearing badly. If a person takes a subway to go from one place to the other for half an hour in the morning and a half an hour in the evening, and every day has to _ on his audio device because there is so much of noise of the train and everything around, and is listening to for one hour every day, his hearing is going to be hurt seriously in a few years, in a couple of years time, for sure. There can be many kinds of unsafe levels of sound. It depends on how loud the sound is and how long you listen to it. Unsafe can mean noise levels of 85 decibels for eight hours a day or 100 decibels for just 15 minutes. There are simple ways to protect people from unsafe sound levels. Young people who wear earplugs during concerts can enjoy music at 90 decibels as much as they can at 110 decibels. But earplugs may not look very cool. The fact that earplugs may look un-cool may be true today, but if there is nothing wrong with your hearing in the future may be true and wearing earplugs may actually be cool. Another common suggestion is to turn down the volume on your personal audio devices. The World Health Organization also advises young people to limit their use of such devices to less than one hour a day. Besides, the World Health Organization reminds people to use technology, such as smart audio devices keep listening levels safe.

560,"More than four decades ago British scientist Robert Edwards first witnessed the miracle of human life growing inside a test tube at his Cambridge lab. Since that ground-breaking moment, more than four million babies have been born through IVF and in 2010 his great contribution to science was finally recognized as he was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine. The prize for Dr Edwards, who was given a Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Award in 2008, includes a PS900,000 cheque. The Nobel Assembly described IVF as a ""milestone in modern medicine"". With the help of fellow scientist Patrick Steptoe, the Manchester-born physiologist developed IVF -- leading to the birth of the world's first test tube baby. Dr Steptoe died 10 years later but their work has transformed fertility treatment and given hope to millions of couples. It was a scientific breakthrough that transformed the lives of millions of couples. They said: ""His achievements have made it possible to treat infertility, a disease which makes human unable to have a baby. This condition has been afflicting a large percentage of mankind including more than 10% of all couples worldwide."" Louise Brown, the world's first test tube baby, made international headlines when she was born in Oldham, Gtr Manchester, in 1978 to parents Lesley and John who had been fruitlessly trying for a baby since 1969. Ivf-in-vitro fertilisation is the process whereby egg cells are fertilised outside the body before being implanted in the womb. After a cycle of IVF, the probability of a couple with infertility problems having a baby is one in five -- the same as healthy couples who conceive naturally. Professor Edwards, who has five daughters and 11 grandchildren, began his research at Cambridge University in 1963, after receiving his PhD in 1955.He once said: ""The most important thing in life is having a child. Nothing is more special than a child."" With the help of fellow scientist Patrick Steptoe, Prof. Edwards founded the Bourn Hall clinic in Cambridge shire, which now treats more than 900 women a year. Each year, more than 30,000 women in Britain now undergo IVF and 11,000 babies are born as a result of the treatment. But his work attracted widespread criticism from some scientists and the Catholic Church who said it was ""unethical and immoral"". Martin Johnson, professor of reproductive  sciences at the University of Cambridge, said the award was ""long overdue"". He said: ""We couldn't understand why the Nobel has come so late but he is delighted -- this is the cherry on the cake for him."" Professor Edwards was too ill to give interviews but a statement released by his family said he was ""thrilled and delighted"".

Later that day, Ubayd met the cheater and told him not to do it again. Unfortunately, Ubayd' s experience is not unusual. Whether it's kids copying class -mates' answers during tests or friends sharing homework, cheating happens in schools every day. Experts say the behavior starts in the lower grades. Surveys show that one in three elementary students admits to cheating. Jacob Harder, a fourth grader in Ware, Massachusetts, has had classmates ask to copy his homework. ""I wouldn't want to just tell them the answers,"" he says. So instead, he explains the task and encourages his classmates to do it themselves. But many kids find it hard to say no. ""l hear from kids all the time, ' I can' t say no to a friend,'"" says Eric Anderman, a professor at The Ohio State University who studies cheating in school. He says it' s important to say no from the start. ""Then you _ , and the other kid gets the message,"" he says. Plus, he points out, ""a real friend is not going to disown you because he or she couldn't copy your math homework."" The kids doing the copying may feel they need to cheat to be accepted by other kids. And some students may cheat simply because others do. ""If you' re in an atmosphere where cheating is common, you may think that if you don' t cheat, you' re at a disadvantage,"" says Michael Josephson, founder of the Josephson Institute of Ethics. But Josephson says students shouldn't think that way. ""There are a lot of things kids do,"" he says. ""You have to decide what kind of person you' re going to be."" When school becomes too challenging, Anderman suggests going to the teacher rather than relying on the work of others. ""It' s good to ask for help,"" he says.

After dozens of cups of tea and pieces of biscuits, the woman signed a contract and purchased over $7,000 worth of windows. The woman had already talked with 6 excellent salesmen that week, all of whom offered her cheaper ones! That's right---Terry's price was the most expensive and he was also the most inexperienced salesman there ever was. So, what happened then? Here comes the secret. The woman said she liked the young lad more than the others. That's all there was to it. She didn't care about the extra expense. Even the other salesmen couldn't persuade her to pay less than this young lad was asking for. The truth is that the young lad left on the woman the first impression that shone brighter than any of the salesman's talk. First impressions count, not the sales techniques, not the low prices. The actual ""personality"" the kid honestly gave was all that was required. If you market your own products and services, consider what impression you are giving to others.

Outside, Father and Mr. Patrick next door were busy chopping firewood. Inside their own houses, Mother and Mrs. Patrick were engaged in spring cleaning. Somehow the boys had slipped away to the back lot with their kites. Now, even at the risk of having brother caught to beat carpets, they had sent him to the kitchen for more string . It seemed there was  no limit to the heights to which kites would fly today. My mother looked at the sitting room, its furniture disordered for a thorough sweeping. Again she cast a look toward the window. ""Come on, girls! Let's take string to the boys and watch them fly the kites a minute."" On the way we met Mrs. Patric, laughing guiltily as if she were doing something wrong, together with her girls. There never was such a day for flying kites! We played all our fresh string into the boys' kites and they went up higher and higher. We could hardly distinguish the orange-colored spots of the kites. Now and then we slowly pulled one kite back, watching it dancing up and down in the wind, and finally bringing it down to earth, just for the joy of sending it up again. Even our fathers dropped their tools and joined us. Our mothers took their turn, laughing like schoolgirls. I think _ . Parents forgot their duty and their dignity; children forgot their everyday fights and little jealousies. ""Perhaps it's like this in the kingdom of heaven,"" I thought confusedly.

These rules are contained in books. A lawyer learns them mainly by reading books. He begins by doing little else than reading, and after he has prepared himself by three years' study, still, he has to, almost every day, read more about some new questions which he has to answer. The power to use books, then, is a special skill which a would-be lawyer ought to possess. He ought to have enough flexibility to make it easy for him to collect ideas from printed words. He ought to have some readiness to find what a book contains, and something of an instinct for where to look for what he wants. But although this is the power which he will first feel in need of, it is not the most important.

574,"In many romantic movies or TV shows one scene always appears. It involves a handsome man standing outside a young woman's window, singing a love song to her to win her over. However, trying to woo a female with songs is not just something that humans do. A few animals sing love songs as well. Birds and elephants are romantic but the latest animal to  _ a female might surprise you--it is the humble mouse.     You may find it odd to find out that mice sing. We do not hear them because the frequency of their voice is so high. In fact, scientists have known for some time that male mice make special sounds to females, but it has always been assumed that the sounds are produced instinctively   and randomly, with little thought going into the process. But new research suggests otherwise. When male mice with different voices were put in a cage together, scientists found that they would gradually change their pitches   to sound like one another. But when a female mouse was put in the cage with two males, one male would change his pitch to match the other. ""It was usually the smaller animal changing the pitch to match the larger animal,"" professor Erich Jarvis, leader of the study, from Duke University, US, told BBC News. This ability, known as vocal learning, is rare in the natural world. It had been thought to be limited to some birds, such as parrots--as well as whales and dolphins. The latest findings challenge the long-held opinion that mice cannot learn to adapt their voices.     Scientists also found the part of the brain that controls the mice's singing ability. In the experiment, they damaged the cells in this part of the mice's brain and found that the animals couldn't keep their songs in pitch or repeat them any more. This also happened when the mice became deaf. Jarvis said that this finding had changed his understanding of the way mice make sound. ""In mice we find that the pathways that are at least modulating   these vocalizations   are in the forebrain, in places where you actually find them in humans,"" he said. ""If we're not wrong, these findings will be a big boost to scientists studying diseases like autism and anxiety disorders."" Which of the following is proven wrong by the latest discovery?",The frequency of mice's voice is so high that it's impossible for humans to hear it.,When male mice make special sounds to females they can't control the sounds.,Birds and elephants are both romantic animals that are good at expressing love.,Animals like mice are smart even though they often make sounds randomly.,B
575,"What is the difference between a college and a university? This is a good question for students who want to attend a college or a university in the United States. Colleges and universities have many things in common. Both provide a greater understanding of the world and its past. Both provide education in the arts and sciences. And both can help prepare young people to earn a living. Students who complete their undergraduate studies either at a four-year college or a university receive a bachelor's degree. One difference is that many colleges do not offer graduate studies. Universities are generally bigger, offer more programs and do more research. Modern universities developed from those of the Middle Ages in Europe. The word ""university"" comes from the Latin ""universitas"". This described a group of people organized for a common purpose. The word ""college"" comes from a Latin word with a similar meaning, ""collegium"". In England, colleges were formed to provide students with places to live in. Usually each group of students was studying the same thing. So college came to mean an area of study. But a college can also be a part of a university. The first American universities divided their studies into a number of areas and called each one a college. This is still true. Programs in higher learning may also be called schools. The University of Arizona in Tucson, for example, has 18 colleges and 10 schools. They include the colleges of pharmacy  , education, engineering and law. They also include the schools of architecture, dance and public administration. College is also used as a general term for higher education. A news report might talk about ""college students"" even if they include students at universities. Or someone might ask, ""Where do you go to college?"" Today, most American colleges offer an area of study called liberal arts. These are subjects first developed and taught in ancient Greece. They include language, philosophy and mathematics. The purpose is to train a person's mind instead of teaching job skills.

His father was an importer of tools and other goods. His mother was a painter. Window got his interest in drawing and painting from his mother. But his father also supported his son's interest. Once, on a business trip to London, Charles Homer bought a set of drawing examples for his son to copy. Young Winslow used these to develop his early skill. Winslow's older brother Charles went to Harvard University in Cambridge. The family expected Winslow would go, too. But, at the time, Harvard did not teach art. So Winslow's father found him a job as an assistant in the trade of making and preparing pictures for printed media. At 19, Window learned the process of lithography .This work was the only formal training that Winslow ever received in art. In 1859, Window Homer moved to New York City to work for Harper's Weekly. Homer also started to paint seriously. He hoped to go to Europe to study painting. But, something would intervene the direction of Window Homer's artistic work. Harper's magazine would send him to draw pictures of the biggest event in American history since independence. It was the Civil War between the Union and the rebel southern states. Winslow Homer went to Washington, D. C., in 1861. He drew pictures of the campaign of Union Army General George McClellan the next year. His pictures of the war showed many ways that conflicts affect people.

577,"You've just come home, after living abroad for a few years. Since you've been away, has this country changed for the better or for the worse?     If you've just arrived back in the UK after a fortnight's holiday, small changes have probably surprised you--anything from a local greengrocer suddenly being replaced by a mobile-phone shop to someone in your street moving house. So how have things changed to people coming back to Britain after seven, ten or even 15 years living abroad? What changes in society can they see that the rest of us have hardly noticed--or now take for granted? To find out, we asked some people who recently returned. Debi: When we left, Cheltenham, my home town, was a town of white, middle-class families--all very conservative  .The town is now home to many eastern Europeans and lots of Australians, who come here mainly to work in hotels and tourism. There are even several shops only for foreigners.     Having been an immigrant   myself, I admire people who go overseas to find a job. Maybe if I lived in an inner city where unemployment was high, I'd think differently, but I believe foreign settlers have improved this country because they're more open-minded and often work harder than the natives.     Christine: As we flew home over Britain, both of us remarked how green everything looked. But the differences between the place we'd left behind and the one we returned to were brought sharply into focus as soon as we landed. To see policemen with guns in the airport for the first time was frightening -- in Cyprus, they're very relaxed -- and I got pulled over by customs officers just for taking a woolen sweater with some metal-made buttons out of my case in the arrivals hall. Everyone seemed to be on guard. Even the airport car-hire firm wanted a credit card rather than cash because they said their vehicles had been used by bank robbers. But anyway, this is still a green, beautiful country. I just wish more people would appreciate what they've got.

There are among some 40 collections that are being shown at ""The Museum Of""--the first of several new museums which, over the next two years, will exhibit the objects accumulated by unknown collectors. In doing so, they will promote a popular culture of museums, not what museums normally represent. Some of the collections are fairly common--records, model houses. Others are strangely beautiful--branches that have fallen from tree, for example. But they all reveal  a lot of things: ask someone what they collect and their answers will tell you who they are. Other on the way include ""The museum of Collectors"" and ""The Museum of Me.""These new ones, it is hoped, will build on the success of ""The Museum Of."" The thinkers behind the project want to explore why people collect, and what it means to do so.

583,"Outdoor air pollution leads to more than 3 million premature deaths each year, and more than two thirds of them occur in China and India, according to new research. The authors estimate that without government intervention, the total number of deaths could double by 2050. The study, published in the journal Nature, identifies particulate matter  as the prime pollutant leading to premature mortality. Particulate matter, a substance formed as a combination of different materials released into the air, is thought to be harmful to human health once it exceeds 2.5 micrometers in diameter. Researchers also identified ozone as a contributor to dangerous air quality. The causes of air pollution vary dramatically from place to place. In India and China, the study says, emissions from residential heating and cooking drive air pollution by creating unhealthy quantities of smoke. Overall, residential heating emissions cause one third of air pollution-related deaths worldwide. In highly regulated areas, like the United States, Europe and Japan, emissions from agriculture tend to be primary contributors to air pollution. Fertilizer used in agriculture releases ammonia into the atmosphere, a process that creates harmful particulate matter. Globally, air pollution from agriculture kills more than 600,000 people annually, the study finds. The findings are consistent with a 2014 report from the World Health Organization that suggested that 7 million deaths occur annually due to both indoor and outdoor air pollution. The study's conclusions give a sense of urgency to efforts to reduce air pollution but present challenges because of difficulty regulating heating activity in people's homes, according to study author Jos Lelieveld. People who live in the most affected areas should be provided with information about less toxic heating methods, he said. ""It's important to reduce emissions from residential energy use,"" Lelieveld said on a conference call for journalists. ""You can't ask people to stop eating and cooking, but you can provide better technologies."" Air pollution contributes to a variety of ailments that eventually lead to premature mortality like lung cancer, stroke and heart failure, according to the study. Another study published this week in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives reached similar conclusions showing the devastating   effects of pollution on individual health. Researchers found that chronic exposure to particulate matter increases the chance of early death by 3%. That risk is especially high for heart disease; the chance a person will die of heart disease increases by around 10% with chronic exposure to particulate matter. Researchers found that the number of deaths is expected to double by 2050 without new government policies. Nearly all of the increase will occur in Asia, according to the report. What can be inferred from the article?",Residential energy use should be stopped.,Chronic exposure to particulate matter increases the chance of early death by 3%.,The number of deaths is expected to double by 2050 due to air pollution.,It is urgent for the government to take action.,D
584,"Imagine living in a city made of glass. No, this isn't a fairy tale. If you could grab your diving gear and swim down 650 feet into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Washington State, you would witness the secret world of glass reefs. The reef you'd be looking at is made up of glass sponges . But how can animals be made of glass? Well, glass is formed from a substance called silica. The sponges use the silica found in ocean waters to build glass structures that will give them shape and support. Be careful! Some of the fragile creatures are up to 200 years old. When sponges die, new ones grow on top of the pile of old ones. Over centuries, a massive and complex reef takes shape. Some sponges look like wrinkled trumpets, while others look like overgrown cauliflower or mushrooms. Dr. Paul Johnson, who discovered the Washington reef in 2007, also found other surprises such as bubbles of methane  gas flowing out of the seafloor nearby. The methane feeds bacteria, and the bacteria feed the glass sponges. ""It's a new ecosystem we know nothing about,"" said Dr. Johnson. The reef of yellow and orange glass sponges is crowded with crabs, shrimp, starfish, worms, snails, and rockfish. The glass reef is also a nursery for the babies of many of these creatures and was called a ""kindergarten"" by scientists. Many animals that live in the reef hang around for a long time, just like the sponges. Rockfish, for example, live for more than 100 years. Scientists are just beginning to study all the species that call the reef home. The Washington coast isn't the only place where a living glass reef has been found. The first was discovered in Hecate Strait off the coast of British Columbia in 1991. Scientists all over the world were to see it.

585,"New software is able to analyze exactly how many hairs there are in a patch of skin and could help in testing the effectiveness of baldness  treatments and depilatory  creams, say Australian researchers. Researchers from CSIRO Mathematical and Information Sciences in prefix = st1 /Sydneyreport their findings in the November issue of the journalSkin Research and Technology. The software, developed with a UKcompany, will make it easier for researchers developing hair removal creams to accurately assess how well they work, says Dr Pascal Vallotton. ""Up to now they were counting the number of hairs that survived after treatment by hand. That's hard work and it's difficult because you may count a hair twice or you may miss it."" he said. The software relies on images captured by a small flatbed scanner  pressed onto the skin. Using a mathematical algorithm , the software then identifies and traces each individual hair based on an understanding of a hair's unique features, such as its   straightness.  The software is able to distinguish between hairs and other features on the skin such as wounds or moles .  ""Our skin irregularities  make it difficult to say this is a hair or this is a mole,"" Dr Vallotton said.  Comparison between earlier and later images can also determine if hair is growing quickly or slowly, he says. Unfortunately, to check the accuracy of the software, the researchers still had to adopt the old-fashioned method of counting hairs, helped by volunteers from neighboring labs who put their skins on the line for science. ""We had 12 volunteers, mostly from neighboring labs, and we acquired images of hair before and after treatment,"" Dr Vallotton said. To ensure an accurate count, the individual hairs had to be marked off as they were counted, but after such a laborious process, the researchers were pleased to discover the software results were comparable to the manual  count. Dr Vallotton says the software could also be useful in testing the effectiveness of balding  treatments and counting or tracing substances other than hairs, that are long and thin and otherwise difficult to image. What plays a key role in counting the number of hairs with the software?",A scanner.,A calculator.,A hair's unique feature.,A mathematical algorithm.,A
586,"In the mid-1950s, I was a somewhat bored early-adolescent male student who believed that _ . One day, this approach threw me into embarrassment In Mrs. Totten's eighth-grade math class at Central Avenue School in Anderson, Indiana, we were learning to add and subtract decimals  . Our teacher typically assigned daily homework, which would be recited in class the following day. On most days, our grades were based on our oral answer to homework questions. Mrs. Totten usually walked up and down the rows of desks requesting answers from student after student in the order the questions had appeared on our homework sheets. She would start either at the front or the back of the classroom and work toward the other end. Since I was seated near the middle of about 35 students, it was easy to figure out which questions I might have to answer. This particular time, I had completed my usual two or three problems according to my calculations. What I failed to expect was that several students were absent, which threw off my estimate. As Mrs. Totten made her way from the beginning of the class,I desperately tried to determine which math problem I would get. I tried to work it out before she got to me, but I had brain freeze and couldn't function. When Mrs. Totten reached my desk,she asked what answer I'd got for problem No. 14. ""I...I didn't get anything,""  I answered,and my face felt warm. ""Correct,"" she said. It turned out that the correct answer was zero. What did I learn that day? First, always do all your homework.

588,"It was in the Victorian Era   that the novel became the leading form of literature in English. Most writers were more concerned to meet the tastes of the middle class. The best known works of the period included the works of Charles Dickens and the Bronte sisters and others. Charles Dickens came on the literary scene in the 1830s. Dickens wrote vividly about London life and the struggles of the poor. Most of his works were written in a very humorous style, which was popular with readers of all classes. The Bronte sisters were English writers of the 1840s and 1850s. They began to write from early childhood. In 1846 they published the first book at their own expense as poets; however, their book attracted little attention, selling only two copies. Then the sisters turned to writing novels, each producing a novel in the following year. An interest in rural  matters and the changing social and economic situation of the countryside may be seen in the novels of Thomas Hardy and a number of others. Literature for children developed as a single style. Some works became well-known, such as those of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear. Adventure novels were written for adults but are now generally grouped in the list for children. Helen Beatrix Potter was an English author at the end of the Victorian Era, best known for her children's books, which featured (......) animal characters.

You would probably say, ""When I close my eyes my eyesight cannot get out of my eyes to get to the book. "" But this explanation is wrong.      You cannot see any object unless light from that object gets into your eyes. Some of the things you see give off light of their own. The sun, the stars, a lighted lamp are examples of that can be seen by their own light. Such things are luminous. Most of the things you see are not giving off light of their own. They are simply reflecting   light that falls on them from the sun or some other luminous body. The moon, for example, does not give off any light of its own. It is non-luminous. You see it because sunlight falls on it and some of it reflects in your direction. So moonlight is only second-hand sunlight.     When you look at a book, it sends to your eyes some of the light which falls on it, and you see the book. If light could be kept out from where you are so that there would be no light for the book to reflect, then you could not see the book even with your eyes wide open.      Light travels so fast that the time in which it travels from the book you are reading to your eyes is so short as if there were no time at all. Light reaches us from the moon, which is about 380,000 kilometres away, in only a little more than a second.

590,"It is common for older people to forget things. Now an American study has found that memory starts to fail when we are young adults. People younger than thirty years of age usually do not know that they are starting to forget information. But scientists from the University of Michigan say the loss of memory has usually already started. Researchers say people do not observe this slow reduction in mental ability until the loss affects their everyday activities. Denise Park led the new study. She directs the Centre for Aging and Cognition at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. Her team studied more than 350 men and women between the ages of twenty and ninety years. The study identified people in their middle twenties with memory problems. She says young adults do not know they are forgetting things because their brains have more information than they need. But she says that people in their twenties and thirties are losing memory at the same rate as people in their sixties and seventies. Ms. Park says people between the ages of sixty and seventy may note the decrease in their mental abilities. They begin to observe that they are having more trouble remembering and learning new information. The study found that older adults are more likely to remember false information as being true. For example, they remembered false medical claims as being true. Younger people remembered hearing the information. But they were more likely to remember that it was false. Ms. Park is now using modern imaging equipment to study what happens in the brains of people of different ages. She is studying what parts of the brain older adults use for different activities compared to younger adults. Ms. Park says mental performance is a direct result of brain activity and brain structure. She says keeping the brain active is important. She hopes future studies will identify ways to improve the operation of our aging minds.

593,"The Loss of Innocence  Innocence is such a precious gift. It's explained as freedom from guilt or wrong doing. Just imagine never having to worry about anything and having a guilt-free mind. Some people wish to save this kind of innocence from being lost from childhood to adulthood. What would the world be like if innocence were never lost? One way it would benefit humanity is the lack of hatred   among the world. During youth, there may be an occasional argument, even a little physical fight, but nothing like firing a handgun at a fellow human being. And children are blind towards the racial differences of others. A kid will hang out with any other kid. It is the lack of innocence and the ignorance we learn from adults that influence children otherwise. Another benefit is the constant desire for fun and adventure. With very little if any time at all for fun, the adventurous mind is lost in time with the responsibilities placed upon adults. If innocence were kept alive, these ambitions would never depart from our lives. However, other people actually hate the idea of innocence lasting for ever. They feel that the lack of organization and mental power of those with innocence would cause extremely destructive consequences to society in general. A large number of individuals would never have the urge to learn, work, and act upon the necessary needs for humanity to survive. Without a proper education which is usually provided by those who no longer live in a world of innocence, people would not have the desire to succeed, get a good job in life, or provide income for their families, which would hurt the lives of children. The lack of a good education and career would also harm the economy. As long as innocence is kept alive, no one would be terribly angry at the lack of effort people put out in the workplace, resulting in a strong decline  in production and quality of needed goods. Maybe it is wrong in wanting to save innocence. It sure is a nice thought, though. Perhaps innocence was meant to be lost. It was god's will to make things the way they are, and there is a good purpose for everything. All that remains to be said about innocence is to enjoy it while it lasts.

No respectable cowboy, however, would wear short sleeves so I sweated while I played. One day my parents gave me a bb gun. It looked just like a gun that all the cowboys used in the movies. I spent hours each day during those summer months shooting at stumps and pretending to be John Wayne (film actor who played tough heroes). As I was coming into the house one afternoon, though, I tried it one time too many. The gun that I thought was empty let out a soft pop and a bullet flew across the room and parted the hair of my Dad who was asleep on the couch. My Dad took one look at the bb hole a half inch above his head, walked over to me, took my gun, walked outside, and calmly broke it in half. I didn't cry too much over this. I knew how close I had come to hurting my Dad with my stupidity. I didn't expect to ever get another bb gun either. That is why I was so surprised when my Dad bought me another one the next year. I guess he thought I had wised up enough to know how to use it this time. I never put a single bb in the new gun, but in my imagination John Wayne rode again. I eventually outgrew my cowboy stage, but I never did outgrow my appreciation for my Father's forgiveness. He showed me that even when I messed up in the worse way I was still loved.

598,"Washington: NASA has announced evidence that Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, has a saltwater ocean under its icy surface. The ocean seems to have more water than all the water on Earth's surface, according to new Hubble observation. New Hubble observations of Ganymede's magnetic field strongly suggest that the moon, which is the largest in our whole solar system, is home to a subsurface ocean. Scientists estimate the ocean is 95 kilometres thick, which is about 10 times deeper than Earth's oceans. But unlike our salty waters, Ganymede's ocean is buried under 150 kilometres of ice. While scientists have speculated  since 1970s about the presence of an ocean on Ganymede------the largest moon in our solar system------ until now the only observational evidence came from a brief flyby by the Galileo spacecraft, which didn't observe the moon long enough to confirm a liquid ocean. This discovery marks an important milestone, highlighting what only Hubble can accomplish. In its 25 years in orbit, Hubble has made many scientific discoveries in our own solar system. A deep ocean under the icy surface of Ganymede opens up further exciting possibilities for life beyond Earth. Scientists have already confirmed the existence of an ocean on Europa, another moon orbiting Jupiter, and NASA has announced plans to send an unmanned mission there searching for the life that might come with liquid water. Hubble is a telescope that orbits Earth, but because of its impressive gravitational analyses it can be used to study the inside of far distant planets. Using these same principles, scientists could theoretically detect oceans on distant planets as well. What can we learn about the Ganymede from the passage?",It is a planet with the largest moon in our whole solar system.,Its ocean adds to people's excitement about life beyond Earth.,It will be used by NASA as a base for the Hubble telescope.,Its liquid ocean was first proved by the Galileo spacecraft.,B
599,"A long time ago, in an Italian city, the people there built a tower which was admired by everyone passing through. A little further down the road, in a neighboring city, they had built a tower of similar beauty. The two towers were equally well known. The people of the second city, envious   and filled with pride, planned to destroy the neighboring tower so it wouldn't take attention away from their own. One night, they came to the tower and began to quietly its foundations . The next morning, the tower was leaning  slightly ,but nobody noticed. The same happened for the following few days, until a little girl who was passing by pointed up at the tower and said: "" I think the tower is going to fall down."" And everyone around looked closely, and could see that she was right .Nervousness spread through the city. And they tried many methods to try to straighten the tower, but nothing seemed to work. That was, until one day when the same little girl was walking up again, and she put her arm on the side of the tower to rest. She felt the tower shaking slightly. When she took her hand off it, the movement stopped. And when she put it back on again, the same thing happened. The girl spent a while doing this, until she was completely certain of what she had discovered: "" The tower is ticklish ( ) !"" She ran to get some plants, and she planted them right next to the tower. Now if the tower leant over any further it would be tickled by the leaves of those plants. Being a ticklish tower, it would then return to where it had been. In this way, the girl managed to make sure that the tower didn't fall down, but still kept it leaning a little. The fact that it was leaning made it even more famous, and this taught a fine lesson to the envious people of the neighboring city. What lesson can we learn from the practice of the envious people in the neighboring city?",All that ends well is well.,Every dog has his day.,A bad beginning makes a bad ending.,A friend is never known till a man has need.,C

602,"Students often want to practice their English outside class. One of the best ways to practice your English is to speak to a foreigner. You may ask, ""Is it okay to try to talk to foreigners I see in the street?"" The answer is yes and no, but probably no! If you see a foreigner who looks lost, it is polite to ask him, ""May I help you?"" But, otherwise, you should probably let them get on with their business. Situations, however, do exist where it is quite all right to talk to foreigners. If a foreigner enters your school, classroom, office, shop or restaurant, for instance, feel free to ask him (for example): -- What is your name? -- Where do you come from? -- What do you think of Beijing? -- How long will you stay in Beijing? There are also situations where it's okay to talk to foreigners in public places. If you see a foreigner alone in a restaurant, bar or coffee shop, it may be appropriate to ask him or her: -- Is this seat free? -- Do you mind if I talk to you in English? You can probably help them if they are new in China and if they are alone, you may be able to make them feel more welcome. After a few such questions, you should know whether this person wants to talk to you or not. If they ask you similar questions, or if they give long, informative answers, you're in luck. If not, then give them their privacy. Talking to strangers is fun if you choose the right time and place. When you first meet a foreigner, you should say ""  _  """,Where are you going?,Have you eaten your dinner?,Can you help me with my English?,Nice to meet you.,D

""We are going to talk about extreme life extension,"" he says. ""I am talking in details about allowing us to go into our second century of life with the energy that you have when you are a young person."" Owing to advances in technology and research on how diet affect the aging process, Dr Oz says it might be possible for some people to live to see their 120th birthdays. There's one man in Oprah's audience who Dr Oz says may become the first man in history to live to be 150 years old. Joe Cordell is one of thousands around the world who believe they've found the key to an extreme long life --- calorie restriction leads to a longer, healthier life. At 59 Joe weighs 130 pounds. He may not look like a person who needs to count calories, but as part of his life extension program, he inspects every mouth of food that passes through his system. Every day for the past seven years, Joe has limited himself to about 1,950 calories. He believes that by eating less and restricting his caloric intake, he will _ a genetic switch that slows the aging process. Joe doesn't take away himself of food. Instead, the then 52-year-old father filled up on natural fruits, vegetables and lean proteins  that were packed with necessary vitamins and nutrients. ""Whenever you are thinking about calorie restriction, you should continually think about getting the most nutritional amount per calorie,"" Joe says. In keeping with this principle, Joe starts every morning with three apples...but he only eats the peels. ""Most of the fiber is in the peel, and more importantly, most of the nutrients are in the peel,"" he says. ""It is important to eat some nuts with breakfast so that you do take in some fat, some healthy fats,"" he says. ""I think it helps the absorption of the nutrients, and it is very filling."" For lunch, Joe usually eats a large salad, loaded with vegetables. At dinnertime, he and his family enjoy lean meat or fish and more vegetables. When Joe started practicing calorie restriction, he weighed 175 pounds. Since then, he has lost 45 pounds, and he says he hasn't had a cold in seven years. Though he is in his ""golden years"", researchers studying Joe say he has the body of a 20-year-old athlete. What can we learn about Joe since he started the calorie restriction program?",Joe counts the amount of every meal,Joe has never had a cold,Joe eats three apples every morning,Joe has a large salad with vegetables for dinner,B

A study shows that smart phone owners usually start to use their phones early in the morning. They check persona1 emails and Wechat.

I noticed right away that the parking area was very busy. As I was about to exit my car, a lady was about to enter her car to leave. She was parked on the opposite side of me and there was a four way stop behind our parking areas. As the lady tried to back out to leave, some of the shoppers were extremely rude to her. They shouted and beeped their horns  at the lady and she had a look of terror on her face. She looked at me and threw up both of her hands as if she didn't know what to do. I gestured  for the lady to put her window down and I told her that she was doing just fine. She smiled and seemed to relax. I then became her rear view mirror as it was hard for her to see behind her while backing out of the parking space. As I watched for safety, she was able to back out enough to drive forward. At this point, she was smiling broadly!She thanked me many times. I felt that many of the other drivers weren't sympathetic  enough toward. I was happy to help that lady.

606,"A few years ago, a company called Space Marketing came up with a plan to send a mile-long advertisement into space. To advertising agencies  , it would have been ""a dream come true"". However, advertising standards agencies finally decided not to allow Space Marketing to go ahead with their plans and they were forced to give them up. Space may indeed be the final place for advertisers, because on Earth we are already surrounded by advertising wherever we are and whatever we are doing. Apart from the obvious adverts that we see every day on TV, and in newspapers and magazines, there is a whole ' _ ' of advertising messages for our attention. There are ads that we see on the side of the bus we catch to work, for example. And what about the logos   we see on the clothing of the people we walk past in the streets? Most of the time, we are probably not even aware of   these less obvious advertising methods, but that doesn't mean that they don't work. Take 'product placement', for example. You are in a cinema, watching the latest Hollywood movie. Look carefully at the make of car your favorite actor is driving. And what about his watch? Can you see what brand it is? Chances are, you can, and the company that owns the brand is likely to have paid thousands for it to appear in the film. So, whether Space Marketing finally succeeds in sending ads into space or not is perhaps less important than it might seem. This would not change a thing. Our everyday lives are already strongly influenced by advertising whether we realize it or not. As a form of advertising, product placement   _  .",costs a little,doesn't work,is less obvious than TV ads,mainly appears in Hollywood movies,C

In January, 2013, researchers from the University of Michigan Mott Children's Hospital did a national survey of more than seven hundred families with teens. They found that only one percent of parents believe their child has taken a study drug. Yet in a 2012 University of Michigan study, ten percent of second-year high school students and twelve percent of third-year high school students say they use a study drug. The misuse of study drugs didn't come to the attention of almost all parents.""What we found in this survey is a clear mismatch ,""said Dr. Matthew Davis, one of the researchers. It is a mismatch between what parents believed and what their kids were reporting. ""We know teens are spreading the word that these drugs can improve their grades,""Davis said.""But these prescription medicines are drugs. And teens who use them without a prescription are taking a serious risk."" The new survey showed that fifty-four percent of white parents were""very concerned""about their child taking study drugs, compared with thirty-eight percent of Hispanic  parents and thirty-seven percent of black parents. However, just twenty-seven percent of parents surveyed have talked to their teens about using study drugs. Of these parents, forty-one percent were black, twenty-seven percent were white and seventeen percent were Hispanic.

616,"Scratchy throats, stuffy noses and body aches all spell misery, but being able to tell if the cause is a cold or flu may make a difference in how long the misery lasts. The American Lung Association (ALA) has issued new guidelines on combating colds and the flu , and one of the keys is being able to quickly tell the two apart. That's because the prescription drugs available for the flu need to be taken soon after the illness sets in. As for colds, the sooner a person starts taking over-the-counter remedy, the sooner relief will come. The common cold and the flu are both caused by viruses. More than 200 viruses can cause cold symptoms, while the flu is caused by three viruses - flu A, B and C. There is no cure for either illness , but the flu can be prevented by the flu vaccine, which is, for most people, the best way to fight the flu, according to the ALA. But if the flu does strike, quick action can help. Although the flu and common cold have many similarities , there are some obvious signs to look for. Cold symptoms such as stuffy nose, runny nose and scratchy throat typically develop gradually, and adults and teens often do not get a fever. On the other hand, fever is one of the characteristic features of the flu for all ages. And in general, flu symptoms including fever and chills, sore throat and body aches come on suddenly and are more severe than cold symptoms. The ALA notes that it may be particularly difficult to tell when infants and preschool age children have the flu. It advises parents to call the doctor if their small children have flu-like symptoms. Both cold and flu symptoms can be eased with over-the-counter medications as well. However, children and teens with a cold or flu should not take aspirin for pain relief because of the risk of Reye syndrome  ,a rare but serious condition of the liver and central nervous system. There is, of course, no vaccine for the common cold. But frequent hand washing and avoiding close contact with people who have colds can reduce the likelihood of catching one. If children have flu-like symptoms, their parents   _  .",are advised not to give them aspirin,should watch out for signs of Reye syndrome,are encouraged to take them to hospital for vaccination,should prevent them from mixing with people running a fever,A

""In the photo you can see the elephant with the lady in her back garden and that's almost all we know. So we're just trying to find a little bit more information and we are not even sure if the lady is alive today, but maybe her relatives or somebody will recognize the back of that house and we can fill in some detail on this story.""

620,"The quickest way to make friends with others is to smile  . When you smile, people think you are friendly and easy to talk to. It may not be easy to smile at first, but you can practice it in front of a mirror  . When you look at yourself in the mirror, think about the difference between a smiling face and a sad or an angry face. Most people will stay away from  a sad or an angry face. The easiest way to start a conversation with someone is to say something nice about him or her. For example, you can _ someone's great answer to a teacher's question, a great prize, a nice shirt, etc. Think about how great you feel when someone says something nice to you. Doesn't it make you want to keep talking with that person? Also, ask your new friends questions about themselves.

New research for the Institute for Economic and Social Research could solve this quandary once and for all.In short,it concludes that going back to work after the birth of a child can have a negative impact on the child's development--unless you have lots of money. ""Growing up in a family in which the mother chooses to work appears to have some adverse consequences for children's welfare,"" the research says.However,it adds that extra money brought in by both parents can reduce the negative effect.The negative effect is also less apparent in children of bettereducated mothers. The research by John Ermisch and Marco Francesconi is especially downbeat about welfare to work programmes,and especially,the prospects for the children of some single parents. ""It is hard to see anything but gloomy   prospects for the children of single parents (who are generally poor),"" the researchers said.This is because in a common family where both parents work,extra money brought in by the mother's working would compensate for less time spent with the children. In contrast,the researchers said the effects of paternal   employment were far more modest,but this did not mean that fathers had no role in shaping their children's welfare.Money brought in by the father would be a major resource for helping children develop. The research says,however,that before parents get too carried away by worrying about working,there are more important issues facing a child's development.Parents' personalities and emotional stability,parenting practices,and the friends and networks that children experience while growing up will be much bigger factors than whether their mothers work.

627,"We all like watching online videos of dogs and cats doing funny things. But if you had to decide, which of the two animals would you say you might like better? Your answer may say something about your personality. According to a 2010 study led by Sam Gosling, a scientist at the University of Texas, US, dog people are about 15 percent more outgoing and 13 percent more pleasant to be friends with than cat people. This is not hard to understand, since cats and dogs behave differently themselves. ""Cats will occasionally _ social activities, but usually after only a few minutes, they will abandon the game. Dogs, on the other hand, will often engage in play, like fetching a thrown ball, for hours at a time,"" said Modern Dog Magazine. Although cat people are less social, Gosling's study showed that they are 11 percent more open-minded than dog people. They usually like art, adventures and unusual ideas. They also have more imagination and curiosity. But dog people are more likely to stick to old beliefs and traditional interests. However, their love of a free lifestyle also means that cat people dislike making plans. They just follow whatever ideas pop into their heads without planning ahead. But dog people are different. They usually have strong self-control and like to carry out their plans. Despite these big differences between dog people and cat people, there are some things that they have in common, ""Both types of people consider themselves close to nature, dislike animal-print clothing, and are generally optimists,"" noted Mother Nature Network. But can personality change? Can a cat person become a dog person, or the other way around?

With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. "" If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?"" media expert Cheryl Olson says.

630,"Common phrases like "" no pains, no gains"" give the impression that we ought to be suffering while we study. It's almost as though the only way to know if we're putting in enough work is the sense of hardship we bear. When we haven't taken the time to come up with another idea, all we know how to do is shut ourselves in a room with a book. It's no surprise that we find revision boring and difficult. Just as children learn from playing, we can learn from doing, or at least from study techniques that interest us, rather than make us switch off. Shutting yourself away can make you learn to hate studying. This leads to a situation where instead of being able to concentrate on your work, you are troubled by how unfair it is that you must study. When you hate your work it's very difficult to make yourself star, or approach it with any kind of structure or enthusiasm. This can be part of a vicious cycle  that traps you into ineffective revision, your poor progress fuelling further annoyance. Just being around other people really helps fight against feelings of loneliness and, thankfully, it's perfectly possible to work in the company of other people. We just need to learn how to deal with distractions . It's not necessary to avoid all company, just idle  company. Studying in the same room as someone who is ironing or working out is perfectly possible. People who are bored and looking to be distracted, however, are terrible to work around. They constantly try to keep others in conversation. It's also a good idea to avoid the company of people involved in activities that you would rather be doing than studying. _  If being around others means working in a noisy environment, a pair of headphones and some background music can block out even noisy children. They also act as a psychological barrier, so that people think twice before interrupting you. When you're studying for a big exam, it seems like your whole life is taken up with study.

There is also quite a rare animal called the red squirrel  . Foxes are red, and they used to be hunted by men in red outfits  . But is red considered lucky to British people?

When a person is ""red faced"", they are out of breath or blushing  . Red is also a political color: it means a left-winger (blue is the color of the political right).

The Apprentice is useful for English students who want to learn how to make up a persuasive   argument. For example, rather than say ""I think I did a good job"", one may also learn to throw off the possibility of uncertainty by saying, ""I did a good job.""

A study of 192 third and fourth grades, generally aged eight and nine, found that children who cut the number of hours spent watching television gained nearly two pounds (0.91 kg) less over a one-year period than those who did not change their television diet. ""The findings are important because they show that weight loss can only be the result of a reduction in television viewing and not any other activity,"" said Thomas Robinson, a pediatrician  at Stanford University. "" American children spend an average of more than four hours per day watching television and videos or playing games, and rates of childhood being very fat have doubled over the past 20 years,"" Robinson said. In the study, presented this week to the Pediatric Academic Societies' annual meeting in San Francisco, the researchers persuaded about 100 of the students to reduce their television viewing by one-quarter to one-third. Children watching fewer hours of television showed a significantly smaller increase in waist size and had less body fat than other students who continue their normal television viewing, even though neither group ate a special diet nor took part in any extra exercise. ""One explanation for the weight loss could be the children unstuck to the television may simply have been moving around and burning off calories,"" Robinson said. ""Another reason might be due to eating fewer meals in front of the television. Some studies have suggested that eating in front of the TV encourages people to eat more,"" Robinson added.

After losing in the primary, Sabel filed nominating petitions containing the requisite number of signatures to become a candidate for the office of governor in the following general election. The chief elections officer of Erehwon refused to certify Sabel's petitions solely because of the above statute. Sabel then filed suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of this Erehwon statute. As a matter of constitutional law, which of the following is the proper burden of persuasion in this suit?

639,"A ""lost tribe"" that reached America from Australia may have been the first Native Americans, according to a new theory. If proved by DNA evidence, the theory will break long established beliefs about the southerly migration of people who entered America across the Bering Strait, found it empty and occupied it. On this theory rests the belief of Native Americans to have been the first true Americans. They would be classified to the ranks of escapee, beaten to the New World by Aboriginals   in boats. To a European, this may seem like an academic argument, but to Americans it is a philosophical question about identity, Silvia Gonzales, of Liverpool University said . Her claims are based on skeletons found in the California Peninsula of Mexico that have skulls quite unlike the broad Mongolian features of Native Americans. These narrow-skulled people have more in common with southern Asians, Aboriginal Australians and people of the South Pacific Region. The bones, stored at the National Museum of Anthropology   in Mexico City, have been carbon-dated and one is 12,700 years old, which places it several thousand years before the arrival of people from the North. ""We think there were several migration waves into the Americas at different times by different human groups,"" Dr. Gonzales said. ""The timing, route and point of origin of the first colonization of the Americas remains a most contentious topic in human evolution."" But comparisons based on skull shape are not considered conclusive by anthropologists, so a team of Mexican and British scientists, backed by the Natural Environment Research Council, has also attempted to take out DNA from the bones. Dr. Gonzales declined yesterday to say exactly what the results were, as they need to be checked, but indicated that they were consistent  with an Australian origin. The skeletons found in the California Peninsula of Mexico have   _  .",the broad skull shape,the narrow skull shape,different features of Aboriginal Australians,the same features of Native Americans,B

We know you can!"" Jason grasped another rope, put his climbing harness on and began to repel down the cliff. Within moments Jason was beside Alexis. She had her cheek directly against the face of the rock with her feet barely resting on a small piece of the cliff that jetted outward.

Errors and uncertainties increase, from dust devils and storms up to continent-size eddies   that only satellites can see.

643,"Tea drinking was common in China for nearly one thousand years before anyone in Europe had ever heard about tea.People in Britain were much slower in finding out what tea was like, mainly because tea was very expensive. It could not be bought in shops and even those people who could afford to have it sent from Holland did so only because it was a fashionable curiosity. Some of them were not sure how to use it. They thought it was a vegetable and tried cooking the leaves. Then they served them mixed with butter and salt. They soon discovered their mistake but many people used to spread the used tea leaves on bread and give them to their children as sandwiches. Tea remained scarce and very expensive in England until the ships of the East India Company began to bring it direct from China early in the seventeenth century. During the next few years so much tea came into the country that the price fell and many people could afford to buy it. At the same time people on the Continent were becoming more and more fond of tea.Until then tea had been drunk without milk in it, but one day a famous French lady named Madame de Sevigne decided to see what tea tasted like when milk was added.She found it so pleasant that she would never again drink it without milk. Because she was such a great lady her friends thought they must copy everything she did, so they also drank their tea with milk in it. Slowly this habit spread until it reached England and today only very few Britons drink tea without milk. At first, tea was usually drunk after dinner in the evening No one ever thought of drinking tea in the afternoon until a duchess   found that a cup of tea and a piece of cake at three or four o'clock stopped her getting ""a sinking feeling"" as she called it.

644,"Although they are an inexpensive supplier of vitamins,minerals,and high--quality protein,eggs also contain a high level of blood cholesterol ,one of the major causes of heart disease.One egg yolk,in fact,contains a little more than two--thirds of the suggested daily cholesterol limit.     This knowledge has caused egg sales to drop in recent years,which in turn has brought about the development of several alternatives to eating regular eggs.One alternative is to eat substitute eggs. These egg substitutes are not real eggs, but they look somewhat like eggs when they are cooked.They have the advantage of having lower cholesterol rates,and they can be scrambled or used in baking.One disadvantage, however,is that they are not good for frying,poaching,or boiling.A second alternative to regular eggs is a new type of eggs,sometimes called""designer''eggs.These eggs are  produced by hens that are fed low-fat diets consisting of ingredients such as canola oil,flax,and rice bran.In spite of their diets,however,these hens produce eggs that contain  the same amount of cholesterol as regular eggs.Yet,producers of these eggs claim that eating their eggs will not raise the blood cholesterol in humans.     Egg producers claim that their product has been described unfairly.They use scientific studies to back up their claim.And  in tact  studies on the relationship between eggs and human cholesterol levels have brought mixed results.It may be that it is not the type of egg that is the main determinant of cholesterol but the person who is eating the eggs.Some people may be more sensitive to cholesterol from food than other people.In fact,there is evidence that certain dietary fats stimulate the body's production of blood cholesterol.Consequently,while it still makes sense to limit one's intake of eggs,even designer eggs,it seems that doing this without regulating dietary fat will probably not help reduce the blood cholesterol level. Which of the following statements is NOT true?",It has been proved that some dietary fats stimulate the body's production of blood cholesterol.,Some people are insensitive to cholesterol from food.,It is the type of egg that determines the level of cholesterol in one's body.,Controlling one's intake of eggs and dietary fat is likely to reduce blood cholesterol.,C

Think of the Belgian capital and, if anything, you think of the small peeing   boy  _   a 60-meter-high bronze figure standing on a block, supplying a constant stream of water to the basin under him.  Some might laugh. But for Jacques Stroobants, the statue is up there with the best of them.  ""I'm proud of him. People come from all around the world to see him,"" says 60-year-old Stroobants with a fatherly glance at the little boy.  As the most famous landmark of Brussels, Manneken Piss has a very special place in the heart of Belgians.  The original Manneken Piss dates back to 1388, but the statue tourists see today dates from 1619 when the city built a second one after the original was destroyed.  Many stories go round Manneken Piss. Nobody knows why he was made. One story is that he saved Brusselsby putting out the flames of a deadly fire with his well-aimed piss. But the most believable story is that the boy, the son of a wealthy man, was kidnapped. The father had a statue built in honor of the way his son was found-peeing against a tree.  Perhaps best-known for his naked beauty, the ""peeing boy"" has also been clothed in some of the finest clothes money can buy.  Stroobants has been changing his clothes for the last 29 years. On average, he has clothes on 300 days a year. And on special days, he pees beer.  A few of the ways he's been dressed are; a football player, Mozart and an army general. Now, he has more than 600 pieces of clothes.  There is no strict charge for those wishing to provide clothes for the little boy. But certain conditions must be met.  ""The clothes cannot include either advertising or political message,"" said Stroobants, because they would cheapen the national treasure.

Einstein remains the foremost scientist of the modern time. Looking back 2,400 years, only Newton ,Galileo and Aristotle were his equals. Around the world , universities and academies are celebrating the 100th anniversary of Einstein's ""miracle year"" when he published five scientific papers in 1905 that basically changed our grasp of space, time ,light and matter. Only he could top himself about a decade later with his theory of relativity. Born in the age of horse-drawn carriages, his ideas launched a technological revolution that has made more changes in a century than in the previous two thousand years. Computers, satellites, telecommunications, lasers, televisions and nuclear power all owe their invention to ways in which Einstein exposed a stranger and more complicated reality underneath the world. He escaped Hitler's Germany and devoted the rest of his life to human rights and peace with an authority unmatched by any scientist today, or even most politicians and religious leaders. He spoke out against fascism and racial prejudice. His FBI file ran 1,400 pages. His letters expose a disorderly personal life - married twice and indifferent toward his children while absorbed in physics. Yet he charmed lovers and admirers with poetry and sailboat outings. Friends and neighbors fiercely protected his privacy.

This caused discomfort and hardship in every level of society; but for many of the nation's poor, discomfort and hardship turned into misery  . An increase in homelessness is probably the worst result of a nation's financial disaster. About 3 million Americans were homeless because of a lack of affordable housing. Experts suggest that a family should spend no more than 30 percent of its income on housing. In fact, in some families housing costs make up 50 percent or more. An unexpected event, such as losing work or illness, can quickly push a family into homelessness. An article in Time magazine tells a story of one such family. A young couple and their three children rented a two-bedroom apartment for about $350 a month. They could hardly go on with the husband's $920-a-month take-home pay; so when their rent was raised to $500 a month, they could no longer make ends meet. Another woman was found dead on a street in Washington D.C., the capital, and she died at a bus-stop across the street from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. People become homeless for different reasons. Some may not be able to pay for housing, because they have lost their job and cannot find another place they can afford. Others have mental diseases, or are addicted to drugs or alcohol, many of whom do not live with their family.

662,"Scientists have argued for long over whether birds show real intelligence. Some scientists believe birds have abilities including communication and different kinds of memory. In some unusual cases, their abilities seem better than those of humans.      Irene Pepperberg, a birds expert, did research about a grey parrot named. Griffin. Ms. Pepperberg says Griffin can arrange objects in order of size. She says the talking bird also can combine words in the right order. For example, he will combine words when asking for a piece of food. The researcher says experts had thought that only humans and other mammals with large brains have the ability to combine objects and words. She believes that bird brains have the ability to understand that complex  tasks must be done in the correct order.      Some birds have other memory skills. For example, they collect and store thousands of seeds in autumn, and find them later in winter. Alan Kamil and Alan Bond of the University of Nebraska are studying the memories of birds called jays and nutcrackers. Their experiments show that these birds use natural objects to find the seeds they have stored.      It's said some birds can learn as many as 2,000 different songs. Songs may have developed as a way for birds to communicate with other birds.      According to Verner Bingman of Bowling Green State University in Ohio, birds must have a special guidance system in their brain. He says that understanding how a bird's brain operates may help us better understand how a human brain processes information.      However, some scientists do still believe birds do many things that appear to be acts of thoughtful intelligence. In most cases, they say, their behavior is simply instinctive , no reasoning power directing it.

663,"For many years, Hawaii has been a magic name to people who like to travel. People on both sides of the Pacific Ocean, in Japan and in America, dream of seeing these beautiful islands in the middle of the ocean. Their dreams always include at least one scene of a sunset over the ocean. In the tropical  lands, the sun drops, like a ball of golden fire, into the sea, and it droops so quickly that you can almost see it move. The sun leaves behind a glow that lights the skies and shines in the quiet water. People often have a quiet, peaceful time ---perfect for a leisurely  walk along the water. This scene is not too different from the dramatic  beauty that greeted the first strangers to these islands centuries ago. They were Polynesian people who came from Tahiti in canoes not much bigger than small boats. They found the beautiful white sand beaches and the waving palm trees, but there were no giant hotels like the ones we see nowadays. The first people came to Hawaii nearly two thousand years ago, but skyscraper hotels were only built in the last 25 years. Now jet planes make it possible to fly to for a weekend from Tokyo. Wherever the people come from, they really want to see the original beauty of Hawaii. They want to see the lovely beaches and the mountain called Diamond Head which is almost hidden by the tall hotels.

664,"When we think about giving help to developing countries, we often think about giving money so that these countries can build schools and hospitals, buy food and medicine, or find clean water supplies. These seem to be the most important basic needs of the people we are trying to help. However, it's far from enough. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got to come up with some better ideas to help them. I was very surprised, then, when I read about a plan to make cheap laptop computers for children in developing countries. A man called Nicholas Negroponte invented a cheap laptop computer, which can run without electricity. He decided to invent this computer after he visited a school in Cambodia. The laptop which Mr. Negroponte has designed is a little different from the normal laptop computers you can buy in the shops. One difference is that it is covered in rubber so that it is very strong and won't be damaged easily. As an electricity supply can be a problem in developing countries, the computer also has a special handle so that children can wind the computer up to give it extra power when needed. These special laptop computers will cost less than 100 US dollars and Mr. Negroponte wants to build as many as 15 million machines in the first year of production. The idea is that these computers will help the children's education as they will be able to access the Internet. These computers might not help the people in developing countries immediately, but by improving children's education they should help people to find their own solutions to their problems in the long term. Another idea to help children in developing countries is to recycle old mobile phones so that they can be used again. In the UK, and, probably in many other countries too, millions of mobile phones are thrown away every year. The waste created by throwing away these old phones is very bad for the environment, so it seems to be an excellent idea to recycle them. In this way we will be able to achieve two important goals at the same time. We will reduce the waste we produce and help others. In other words, we will be able to 'kill two birds with one stone', and that is always a good thing. Where does this passage probably come from?",A magazine,A newspaper,A lecture,An advertisement,C

Kite Surfing It's the exciting mixture of kite, board and waves. The idea of using a kite to accelerate speed seems like a new challenge, yet the art of kite flying dates back to the 13th-century Chinese when _ was used as a simple means of transport. Catch a wind and you're moving -- up, down and across the surf. ""It's always exciting. You'd jump 5 feet or 35 feet. You never know if you're going to go up in the air, and your heart is just going boom, boom, boom."" Coasteering It is by far the best activity and the event that everyone is still talking about. This is exploring the coastline without worrying about a coastal path or finding a rocky bay blocking your route. You climb, dive and swim from one place to another. With Coasteering, you don't have to be able to swim as the wet suit and buoyancy  aid will keep you floating when you are in the water. Sky Diving Traditional parachuting  doesn't sound risky enough. So now sky diving is the name for jumping from a plane and listening to your heart beating heavily as you move fast towards earth before you open your parachute at the last moment. Mountain Biking It's been around so long that bikers are no longer satisfied with just going up and down a mountain.

675,"Sometimes people are not clear about what kind of food is healthy, and what kind of food may do harm to our health. The USDA has prepared a food guide to help people learn about which kind of food is the healthiest to eat. The food guide describes six main food groups: meat (like fish and chicken), dairy (like milk and cheese),grains (like bread and rice), fruit and vegetables. The last group is fats and sweets. The USDA also suggests how much of each food group is healthy to eat daily. Though this guide was prepared by the US government, it is very useful for people all over the world. As a _ of years of study, we know that too much animal fat is bad for our health. For example, Americans eat a lot of meat and only a small amount of grains, fruit and vegetables. Because of the way they eat, they have a high rate of cancer and heart disease. In Japan, people eat large amounts of grains and very little meat. The Japanese also have a very low rate of cancer and heart disease. The Japanese live longer than anyone else in the world. However, when Japanese people move to the US, the rate of heart disease and cancer goes up as their eating habit changes. And as hamburgers, ice creams and other high-fat foods become popular in Japan, the rate of heart disease and cancer is going up there as well. People are also eating more meat and dairy food in other countries, in which the disease rate is going up along with the change of the way people eat. Doctors everywhere suggest people eat more grains, fruit and vegetables and less meat and dairy food. Eating healthily is important for children as well as their parents. When parents have poor eating habits, their children usually do, too. After all, children eat in the same way as their parents. When parents eat healthy food, the children will learn to enjoy it, too. Then they will develop good eating habits. Doctors suggest parents give their children healthier food such as fruit, vegetables and juice. Everyone wants to live a long, healthy life. We know that the food we eat affects us in different ways. For example, doctors believe that fruit and vegetables can really protect people from many different diseases. On the other hand, animal fat can cause diseases.

677,"Internet use appears to cause a decline in psychological well-being , according to research at Carnegie Mellon University. Even people who spent just a few hours a week on the Internet experienced more depression and loneliness than those who logged on less frequently, the two-year study showed. And it wasn't that people who were already feeling bad spent more time on the Internet, but that using the Net actually appeared to cause the bad feeling. Researchers are puzzling over the results, which were completely contrary to their expectations. They expected that the net would prove socially healthier than television, since the Net allows users to choose their information and to communicate with others. The fact that Internet use reduces time available for family and friends may account for the drop in well-being, researchers suggested. Faceless, bodiless ""virtual"" communication may be less psychologically satisfying than actual conversation, and the relationship formed through it may be shallower. Another possibility is that exposure to the wider world via the Net makes users less satisfied with their lives.

Have the participants stand in a circle. One person starts the clap and then turns to face the person next to him. As they are about to make eye contact, they clap together. That next person now has the clap and he has to pass it on. Continue to pass the clap around the circle. Blindfolded Birthday Blindfolded Birthday works well after people have become a little more familiar with each other. Everyone puts on a blindfold. Then, without talking, they have to line up in order of birthdays. Two Truths and a Lie Two truths and a Lie can be played anytime in the group's operations. Have the participants sit in a circle. Each person is supposed to tell two truths and a lie about themselves. The group has to guess which is the lie. Human Knot Human Knot is an activity best played after your group has gotten quite familiar with each other, because there can be a lot of touching going on. Everyone gathers in a circle. They put their right hands in the middle of the circle. They grab someone else's hand. Then the left hands go in the middle and they grab someone else's hand. The group is now knotted up.

He began to sing in the style that is called ""country and western"". In 1955 he recorded some songs for his mother's birthday. The people at the recording studio liked his singing and his music. There was something different about it. It was country and western music, but it also sounded a little like the music, which black people used to sing in the American South, music known as ""blues"". Shortly after that, Elvis met Tom Parker, who became his manager and arranged concerts for him across the United States and new recordings as well. Soon Elvis rose to fame all over the country. Later, Elvis went to Hollywood and began to appear in films like Love Me Tender and King Creole. But Elvis found it hard to live with success, like many other entertainment personalities   .He began to take drugs and his health began to suffer. When he died at an early age of 42 in 1977, his many millions of fans were shocked. ""The King Is Dead!"" the newspaper said. But today his memory and his music live on and he will always be remembered as the King of Rock & Roll.

She stopped and put a hand out to rest against the car. She gently closed her eyes, took a deep breath and wiped the sweat off her forehead. Was there a way I could do anything to help her? But I wondered if the lady noticed me sitting inside the car, she would feel embarrassed and walk away. I stilled my body while my mind searched for answers. I turned my head towards my driver, wanting him to ask the lady if we could give her a ride. Because of my head movement, she noticed me and moved her hand away from the car. Her calm expression changed to a cautious one. I grabbed the water bottle next to me, smile, gently opened the door and offered the bottle to her. She looked at me hesitatingly, shook her head with downcast   eyes and walked away. I was so annoyed with myself. I should have been more careful not to move. However, she was back I opened the door and patted the seat next to me. She sat down, opened her bag and offered me a banana. I took it and offered her the water bottle again. She took it.

The town was never peaceful. Fire broke out once a week on summer afternoons. Residents were puzzled who the real firebug  was. One day a big fire broke out. It was said that a Negro had jumped out of the house on fire, so the police arrested  all the Negroes in the street. However, fire never stopped to breaking out when the Negroes were in prison. Mauson, a physics teacher didn't believe that the Negroes were the firebugs, for he really knew about those Negroes, He made up his mind to find out who the real firebug was. One day he was invited to drink in a pub and happened to notice that many bottles and plastic plates were baked by the hot sunrays. Suddenly he realized what the actual fact was. He jumped with joy, saying, ""I've got the answer!"" Mauson dashed out of the pub to his friend's house nearby, which also faced south. He made an experiment there to confirm his idea. The next Saturday afternoon, Mauson asked some policemen and newsmen to come to the house. They were told that the real firebug would be shown there. At that time the sun was shining full into the house and it became hotter and hotter inside the room. Someone wanted to draw the curtains together, while another was going to use a bottle to drink water, but neither got permission from Mauson, who wanted to let the firebug in. ""Now,"" said Mauson, ""this house will soon catch fire."" People looked at each other in surprise. Mauson asked them to look at the bottles and focus on the table cloth. After a while the cloth gave off a burning smell and began to catch fire! The mystery of fire was discovered, but the police wouldn't believe him and insisted that Negroes had been the firebugs.

684,"Have you ever heard the old saying ,""Never judge a book by its cover"" ?This is a good rule to follow when trying to judge the intelligence of others. Some people have minds that shine only in certain situations. A young people with an unusual gift in writing may find himself speechless in the presence of a pretty girl when he speaks. He may not be able to find the right words. But don't make mistake of thinking him stupid, with a pen and a paper, he can express himself better than anybody . Other people may fool you into overestimating   their intelligence by putting up a good front. A student who listens attentively and takes notes in class is sure to make a favorable impression on his teachers. But when it comes to exams, he may score near the bottom of the class . It all boils down to this: you can't judge someone by appearance. The only way to determine a person's intelligence is to get to know him. Then you can see how he reacts to different situations. The more situation you see, the better your judgment is likely to be. So take your time. Don't judge a book by its cover .

685,"A ""talking kitchen"" teaches students how to cook French dishes and speak French. Researchers at New Castle University have developed the French Digital Kitchen. Professors Paul Seedhouse and Patrick Olivier led the project. Professor Seedhouse says that it works like a satellite navigation system   in a car. The kitchen equipment and tools use motion sensor  technology similar to the Nintendo Wii game system. The sensors help a computer guide the students through instructions in French. The system can tell whether you've done what you were asked to do or not. For example, the system tells you to take some butter and cut it with a knife. There's a sensor on the package containing the butter so it can tell where the butter's being moved. The sensor in the knife not only knows that the knife is moving, but it also knows what motion the knife is making. So it can tell whether the knife is being used. And so it doesn't go on to the next stage of the program unless you've done what it tells you to do. Students can ask the computer to repeat the instructions or translate them into English. There are vocabulary lessons before and after the cooking. Professor Seedhouse became interested in the idea after he visited a talking kitchen designed for a different purpose. ""It was actually for communicating with people who suffer from dementia  "" .And so, for example, it can speak to those people and tell them that they've left the cooker on and they should turn it off.""

686,"There are some things humans can go without. We can lose a kidney or a lung, an arm or two and still live perfectly well. But some fish put us to shame. They can _ without stomachs. One such fish is the stout longtom. The group it belongs to carries a more appropriate name: the needlefish. All needlefish lack stomachs. Their ancestors had them, but later they were lost. The stout longtom can reach 1.3 meters in length, and lives near the sea surface. Like all needlefish, it can jump out of the water to escape its enemies. Tropical fishermen are sometimes injured by needlefish. In 1977, a 10-year-old Hawaiian boy was killed when a needlefish jumped through his brain. The longtom eats smaller fish. It teeth are not good at cutting fish into pieces, so it swallows fish whole. Ryan Day from Australia and his colleagues wanted to know how the longtom digests its meaty meals without a stomach, so they ran some chemical tests about the fish. Day's results show that the longtom can consume food without the help of a stomach. It uses a special material called trypsin that can break down proteins without acid -- although the approach is less efficient than using a stomach. Because it's a meat-eating animal, the longtom gets a lot of protein in its food, so it can afford this slightly less efficient system for absorbing it. Two plant-eating fish that Day studies actually had higher levels of trypsin in their body, as their food was low in protein. Day thinks that the longtom and its stomachless relatives might actually have arrived at an energy-saving solution. He says that although the stomach is critical to many kinds of animal, the organ is ""a fairly expensive organ to run"". This perhaps explains why some animals have got rid of theirs. What plays a key role in the longtom's digestion process?",Trypsin.,Acid,The stomach.,Protein in its body.,A

The calls even came when he and my mother were in Australia, England or Florida. Nine years ago when I bought me first house, my father, 67 years old, spent eight hours a day for three days, painting my house. He would not allow me to pay someone to have it done.

For about 300 days, she stays with the eggs, cleans them and protects them. She does not leave to feed. However, this animal mom dies as soon as the eggs are hatched . Crocodiles   A crocodile mother puts a lot of time and effort  into raising her babies. She starts by building a nest which she guards for over two months! When the eggs are ready to hatch, the young crocs call out to their mother, who digs them out and helps them hatch. She then carries them  in  her mouth down to the water, where she will guard them for several more weeks or months until thy learn to hunt on their own. Bats  Bats become moms by hanging head up in a cave, giving birth. Catching the youngsters before it can fall to the ground below, she puts it in a pouch   .Bat moms may carry babies with them when feeding for the first few days. As the little bats get bigger and heavier, moms help them hang on the wall of their caves and return to feed them. It continues for about three weeks, until the babies are grown up and able to fly on their own. Koalas  The animal mom gives birth after pregnancy of only 35 days. The hairless baby climbs into its mother's pouch and lives there for another five months.

693,"Zoos have been around for centuries -- and they've changed a lot over the years. In the Middle Ages, wealthy people kept animals in their gardens. Public animal parks appeared in European cities in the late 1700s and early 1800s. The Philadelphia Zoo, the first in the United States, opened in 1874. Until a few decades   ago, most zoos were organized by creatures -- monkeys in one area, cats in another, birds somewhere else, just like museum collections. In recent years, zoos have instead begun grouping animals that would normally interact   in the wild. Moreover, instead of closing animals behind bars, designers are creating landscapes like the environments in which these creatures would naturally be found. Nearby signs provide information about the animals and their habitats in parts of the world where they normally live. The Denver Zoo's new Predator Ridge exhibit, for example, aims to teach visitors about Africa. Eight acres of land provide homes for 14 animal species, including lions, porcupines, cranes, and wild dogs. Plants from _ grow alongside African-like landform. Ten-foot-tall mounds   give lions a place from which to survey their surroundings, just as they would do in the wild. Landscape design makes visitors to the Denver Zoo's Predator Ridge exhibit feel like they're really in Africa. Animals in Predator Ridge can't actually be mixed with one another, for safety reasons. But hidden deep channels and other smart features allow visitors to see all the animals at once. Different species can see each other too.

With lower-quality lenses  and image sensors, smartphones probably won't replace professional video cameras anytime soon. Still, some creative filmmakers are extending the borders of smartphone moviemaking by shooting professional-quality films using only smartphones. Soon after Apple's iPhone 4 was released, two filmmakers decided to make a short film using only their iPhone 4s. Michael Koerbel and Anna Elizabeth James shot and edited the one-and-a-half-minute film Apple of My Eye in only 48 hours. Audiences were fascinated with the film, in which a man and his grandfather connect emotionally while admiring a model train set in a store window. The filmmakers followed up their success with Goldilocks, an extraordinary spy novel told over nine, three-minute films. Many filmmakers are convinced that smartphone films are here to stay. One sign is their inclusion in major film festivals. In February 2012, organizers of the Berkshire International Film Festival staged the 10 X 10 On North Festival. Entries included Oliver by Hooman Khalili, an award-winning film about a girl whose special powers enable her to brighten the lives of three lonely people. Another entry was Yearlapse'11, a 365-second film by Zsolt Haraszti that describes an actual journey he made from New York to London. During the festival, which ran from February 16 to 26, these and many other smartphone films were shown at the Beacon Cinema in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

698,"Blind tasting is a very strange activity. Contrary to what many people imagine, it has nothing to do with blindfolds. It involves tasting a wine without seeing the label and it can deliver shocking surprises. I tasted seven champagnes   blind with a group of professionals recently. There was a shock when they discovered the wine most of them preferred carried a label they regarded as their least favorite. That sort of result is especially common with champagne, the most image-driven rather than quality-driven wine of all. But it happens all the time when wine is tasted blind. Because I'm interested in how wines really taste instead of how I think they should, I taste wine blind as often as I can, especially when assessing similar young wines. But blind tasting when you know absolutely nothing about the wine in front of you is something completely different. The most difficult Master of Wine exams include three sessions during which you have a dozen glasses in front of you and nothing more helpful than a printed exam paper asking you to identify each wine as closely as possible, and assess its quality. Now that the MW is behind me, I taste wine completely blind only very rarely, and never in public.

Now when we use a credit card to shop online, money is spent without us seeing it. That means we are already using digital money. Using a card is much easier than searching our pockets for change. It is also safer than carrying a lot of cash. When ATM cards were first introduced, they were not accepted everywhere. But now it's hard to live without them. It's reported that people in Sweden completely stopped using cash last year, and the US might be next. Bionic eye It's no longer something only in a science fiction movie. People who are blind may have a chance to get their sight back--by wearing bionic eyes. A blind eye can no longer sense light, but a bionic eye can use a camera to ""see"" the environment and send data to the mind. Now the bionic eye only allows patients to see lights and unclear shapes. A high resolution image could be just a few years away. Self-driving cars Unlike a human driver, a self-driving car won't get distracted by phone call, the radio or something outside the window. Sensors and cameras on the car would allow it to stick reduce the number of road accidents. You could even take a nap while the car driver itself.

704,"The Batsquatch is described as a great winged bat. It's reported that it lives in the shadows  of Mt. Saint Helens. It has purple skin, red eyes and the character is quite similar to the bat's. Since reports tell it likes eating small animals like chickens, goats and pigs, some believe that it is actually a flying primate . But researchers say that it is more closely related to the fruit bat of northern America. Fear still fills the hearts of men, women and children of Washington. In May of 1980 during the eruption of Mount Saint Helens, the Batsquatch showed itself in the shadows of clouds from the eruption. In 1994, a local mountaineer was able to take pictures of the Batspuatch making the rumor  seem real. During this event some farm animals seemed to disappear though luckily no humans were reported missing at the time. The local mountaineer told about his meeting with the Batsquatch. When he suddenly heard a loud deep voice from the shadows, the mountaineer was knocked down. He tried to look for the creature  that had made the sound. He saw a great creature with purple wings in the sky. It looked like it was about 30 feet tall. The mountaineer kept this story a secret in fear of being laughed at by others but when new stories came in about the Batsquatch he shared his story. The reality of the Batsquatch can no longer be ignored. It is only a creature that is trying to live. Respect! This is how we should take news such as this.

709,"India was once part of the British Empire, but thanks to modern technology and a booming economy, it has turned the tables on its former colonial master. Indian tutors are helping to teach math to British children over high-speed Internet connections. Early results suggest the idea is improving exam results. But not everyone is happy at this ""outsourcing"" of tutoring. It's 3:30, and pupils at Raynham Primary School in London are gathering for their after-school maths lessons. Five time zones-- thousands of kilometers away--their math tutors are also arriving for class. High-speed Internet has made it possible for Indian tutors to teach British pupils in real time. Each pupil gets a dedicated one-to-one online tutor. The students work with activities on their computer screen and wear a headset and microphone to talk to their tutor. The class teacher, Altus Basson, says he has seen an improvement in results. ""There are some children who've really rocketed in their results. Children who struggleto focus in class focus a lot better on the laptops. The real advantage is that each child gets a focused activity and a single tutor,"" he said. Such individualized teaching is the core idea of Brightspark Education, the company that provides the online tutoring, says founder Tom Hooper. ""Children today feel very confident online; they feel very engaged; they feel very in control. And that's half the battle with education.Give them control, make them feel confident and enjoy their learning and you'll see them start to improve and embrace it,"" he said. Raynham Primary School is among the first in Europe to try online tutoring. At between $20 and $25 an hour, it's about half the cost of face-to-face coaching. But some people say an Internet connection is not enough of a connection for teaching and learning. Kevin Courtney is deputy General Secretary of Britain's National Union of Teachers. ""We think, there's a really important emotional connection between a teacher and a child whether it's a whole class or whether it's one-to-one. You need that immediacy of feedback and we're not convinced that that can happen across an Internet connection. In one of the wealthiest.countries in the world, we think that we can afford to have teachers with genuine emotional connection there with the children,"" he said. Brightspark Education says the online tutoring is used only as an addition to supplement regular teaching. The company says its service does not represent a threat to teachers' jobs in Britain. Parents say they're very satisfied with the results they've seen. And what about the children?Children: ""I love it!""I love it!""I hate maths!""

710,"MEXICO CITY: A jetliner from the beach resort of Cancun was briefly hijacked as it landed in Mexico City on Wednesday. The hijackers released all passengers shortly before federal police stormed the plane, and the crew emerged unharmed moments later. Police, who did not fire a single shot, led as many as eight handcuffed men away from the airplane, which was isolated at the end of a runway in an area designed for emergencies. The hijackers' motive was unclear, though Mexican news media initially identified them as Bolivians demanding to speak with Mexican President Felipe Calderon. US, French and Mexican citizens were among the 112 passengers and crew on Aeromexico Flight 576, according to a US official who had been briefed on the situation. The official was not authorized to discuss the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. Mexico's transportation and communications secretary, Juan Molinar, said there was no bomb on the airplane, although some passengers said one of the hijackers held a package that resembled an explosive device, and a bomb squad   was later seen near the airplane. He did not immediately identify the hijackers or speculate on their motive. ""Various people who participated in the act have been detained and we are investigating,"" Molinar said. The attorney general's office said it was opening an investigation into terrorism and kidnapping but did not specify how many people could be charged. Mexican news media initially reported the hijackers were Bolivian, but Bolivia's ambassador to Mexico, Jorge Mancilla, said Mexican authorities had no evidence that was the case. Mancilla said sources told him they could be Colombian or Venezuelan. Several passengers told reporters they did not notice a non-Mexican accent. Passenger Rocio Garcia told the Televisa network that the pilot made an announcement after landing in Mexico City that the airplane was being hijacked. Passengers said the hijackers never communicated with them directly. ""These were scary moments,"" she said. She said she saw one of the hijackers whom she described as a well-dressed, older man. ""He looked fine, like a normal passenger,"" she said. Passenger Daniel Hernandez said he saw a hijacker carrying a Bible.

716,"A deadly strain of avian flu may have passed between people for the first time, experts believe.The avian influenza A (H7N9) virus is thought to have been transmitted between father and daughter in eastern China, according to research published online by the British Medical Journal (BMJ). The findings provide the strongest evidence yet of H7N9 transmission between humans since its discover in February, but its ability to transmit itself _ ""limited and non-sustainable"" by the Chinese researchers behind the study.At the end of June 133 cases had been reported, including 43 deaths. Most infections have been among people visiting markets, selling live birds or among those who had contact with live poultry  in the seven to 10 days before becoming ill. The latest study examined the case of a 60-year-old father who regularly visited a live poultry market and became ill five to six days after his last visit in March. He was admitted to hospital with fever, cough and shortness of breath. Despite intensive care treatment he died of multiple organ failure on 4 May. His 32-year-old daughter, who was previously healthy, looked after him at his bedside before he was admitted to intensive care. She had no known exposure to live poultry before falling ill with a very high temperature, cough and fever. The daughter developed symptoms six days after her last contact with her father and was admitted to hospital where she died of multiple organ failure on 24 April. Follow-up investigations  uncovered almost genetically identical virus strains from each patient, suggesting transmission from father to daughter. Another 43 people were also tested who had had close contact with the father, daughter or both. Dr Peter Horby, senior clinical research fellow at the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Hanoi, Vietnam, said of the study: ""The most likely source of infection for the daughter was her father, during the period that she cared for him while he was ill. ""He said ""limited person to person transmission had been reported for other strains like H5N1 , H7N7, and the pig origin flu virus H3N2. Those strains had been around for more than a decade but have not progressed any further down the path towards a world-wide virus."" ""Limited human-to-human transmission of H7N9 virus is therefore not surprising, but strengthening to monitor it was still needed,"" Dr Horby added. The reason why the daughter died of multiple organ failure was that   _  .","she fell ill with a very high temperature, cough and fever.",she was exposed to live poultry before falling ill.,she had close contact with the father while caring for her sick father .,she sold live birds in five to six days before falling ill .,C
717,"If you want to stay young,sit down and have a good think. This is the research finding of a team of Japanese doctors, who say that most of our brains are not getting enough exercise, and as a result,we are ageing unnecessarily soon.  Professor Taijiu Matsuzawa wanted to find out why otherwise healthy farmers in northern prefix = st1 /Japanappeared to be losing their ability to think and reason at a  ly early age, and how the process of ageing could be slowed down. With a team of partners at Tokyo National University,he set about studying the brain volumes  of a thousand people of different ages and various jobs.  Computer technology enabled the researchers to get exact measurement of the volume  of the front and side sections of the brain,which relate to intellect and feelings,and determine the human character. The back section of the brain,which controls functions like eating or breathing,does not connect with age. One can continue living without intellectual or feeling abilities.  Contraction of front and side parts - as cells die off - was observed in some subjects in their thirties, but it was still not obvious in some sixty and seventy year olds.  Matsuzawa concluded from his tests that there is a simple cure for the contraction normally connected with age using the brain.  The findings show in general conditions that contraction of the brain begins soon among people in the country than in the town. Those are at least at risk,says Matsuzawa,who are lawyers,followed by university professors and doctors. White collar workers doing regular work in government offices are, however,as likely to have shrink   as the farm workers,bus drivers and shop assistants.  Matsuzawa's findings show that thinking can prevent the brain from shrinking. Blood must flow through a circle properly in the head to supply the fresh oxygen the brain cells need.

718,"For all the dinner table, a glass of milk seems to be a constant, at least it was when I was growing up. It was widely believed that milk was integral in building strong bones and teeth. There's no doubt that dairy products  , and milk in particular, are high in protein and calcium, and most milk products are supplemented with Vitamin D and A. While it's well known that our bones need calcium, some studies suggest that high calcium intake doesn't necessarily lower a person's risk for fractures  . A Harvard study found that people who drank two or more glasses of milk had no greater protection from breaking a bone than those who drank a glass or less a week.  There's no doubt that we need calcium. Some anti-dairy supporters claim that dairy can lead to heart disease. Much of this claim is based on high fat and high dairy products, like cheeses and creams, which may indeed contribute to cardiovascular problems. Some studies have linked high milk intakes with a risk of prostate cancer; this seems to be caused by high-fat dairy products, not dairy in general. Although milk was always regarded as one of the most important thing we need for our bones, yet least promoted, factors involved in strengthening bones. Perhaps we should think of dairy as less like a nutrient and more like a food. If you like it, eat it. If not, find  _ .

720,"It never occurred to Sun Yukun that the decision he made four years ago would have an impact on his career. When the 22-year-old entered college in 2009, he decided not to change his rural residence to a students' collective one. But when he finished college and was offered a job with a state-owned enterprise in Beijing, Sun was told that he couldn't accept the offer unless he had an urban hukou (household registration record). This time, he had no choice but to change his residence status. Transferring hukou to a university became optional in 2003, and many students are confronted with the dilemma of whether to do so or not. Professionals suggest they make the decision based on their current situation and future plans. 'I regret transferring my hukou' Wang Jinbi, 20, is an accounting major at Beijing Union University. Coming from Chifeng, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, she transferred her hukou when she enrolled at university. ""I didn't think it was a big deal,"" Wang says. ""Since I'm registering under an urban hukou, it doesn't matter whether it's in Beijing or Inner Mongolia, I thought."" What Wang didn't expect, however, is that she would regret her decision later. ""After two years of study, I've figured out my future plans. I want to return to my hometown and make a living there,"" she says. That means Wang needs to transfer her hukou back again, which she worries will be a troublesome procedure. ""I have a friend who graduated last year. She spent a lot of time and energy transferring her hukou back to her hometown again due to complicated paperworks,"" says Wang. Guidelines for transferring hukou Wang's experience is not uncommon. Many students don't know what their decision means for their future. In order to help these students, Xie Yongqiang, from the Chengdu Municipal Bureau of Justice, posted a guideline for transferring hukou on a micro blog. According to Xie, students should firstly think about where they're going to stay. ""If you like the city where you're studying and are considering staying there after graduation, then you should transfer your hukou,"" he wrote. Students should also transfer their hukou if they intend to participate in an exchange program. According to Ju Haojie, deputy director of the household registration department at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, when applying for exchange programs, it saves a lot of trouble if students have a collective hukou registered under the university. But Xie also made suggestions for students with a rural registration. ""If your family has land and a house, it's possible that you'll get a share of compensation in the event of a forced relocation. For those students, I would recommend them not to transfer their hukou,"" he wrote. This doesn't affect students in terms of receiving medical insurance and other benefits at university. 'I want to stay in Beijing' Sometimes, students abandon their rural hukou for the prospect of a better future. Tang Yanwei is one of them. The 23-year-old from Yantai, Shandong province, had a rural hukou but transferred it after enrolling at Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture. Although there are a lot of preferential policies for rural residents, for Tang, an urban hukou in Beijing is attractive. ""I want to stay in Beijing, so a students' collective Beijing urban hukou is a promising start,"" he says. ""I'll do anything that could help me stay here. After all, there's no turning back for me now.""

722,"The wallet is heading for extinction. As a day-to-day essential, it will die off with the generation who read print newspapers. The kind of shopping, where you hand over notes and count out change in return, now happens only in the most minor of our retailers  , like buying a bar of chocolate or a pint of milk from a corner shop. At the shops where you spend any real money, that money is increasingly abstracted. And this is more and more true, the higher up the scale you go. At the most cutting-edge   retail stores, Victoria Beckham on Dover Street, for instance, you don't go and stand at any kind of cash register when you decide to pay. The staff are equipped with iPads to take your payment while you relax on a sofa. Across society, the abstraction of the idea of cash makes me uneasy. Maybe I'm just old-fashioned. But earning money isn't quick or easy for most of us. Isn't it a bit weird  that spending it should happen in half a blink   of an eye? Doesn't a wallet, that time-honored Friday-night feeling of pleasing, promising fatness, represent something that matters? But I'll leave the economics to the experts. What bothers me about the death of the wallet is the change it represents in our physical environment. Everything about the look and feel of a wallet, the way the materials wear and tear and loosen with age, the plastic and paper and gold and silver, and handwritten phone numbers and printed cinema tickets, is the very opposite of what our world is becoming.

Perhaps I wrote to them (""Expect me with dirty shirts this Friday afternoon""), but more likely I didn't let them know, and just turned up or didn't turn up, not understanding that my parents' dashed hopes of seeing me were a greater casualty of my carelessness than a spoiled tea. And in all this I suspect I was typical, at least of young men. As for our fathers and mothers, none of them talked of ""empty-nest syndrome"", even though its implication that the principal human duty is to protect and feed the young would have suited their generation better than ours. Then, the feelings of loss went without a name. Today, it's a condition with _ , which will make parents feel more enjoyable in their life. The Mayo Clinic, for example, suggests you try to maintain regular contact with your children through ""visits, phone calls, emails, texts or video chats"". If you feel depressed, lean on loved ones or your mental health provider. Above all, stay positive: ""Thinking about the extra time and energy you might have to devote to your marriage or personal interests after your last child leaves home might help you adapt to this major life change."" What can't be denied, however, is that children often leave home. In modern societies, this is what they do. Christmas is the very time they can be depended on to return.

725,"Welcome to our third newsletter of the year! Our major activity for March is our Walk for the Woods fundraising event on Saturday, 17thMarch, starting any time between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. We will be walking the distance between Warley Woods and Tipperary. It is indeed a long way--80 miles. The more people that you can get to sponsor you, the more money we can raise to help look after our beautiful woodland. More information is available on our website. The Sunday volunteers planted two beeches and an oak last week. This was thanks to the money from the Big Tree Plant and to Lisa and Gordon Whitaker, whose friends gave money for the big trees instead of for their wedding presents. Thanks to everyone who took part. There were 15 volunteers at the Oral History Training Day which was led very ably by Julia Letts. The group will be meeting again and will start to interview the local people who have offered to tell their stories. We are happy to hear from others who would like to be interviewed about their memories of the Woods for the project. If you or anyone you know is interested, please call Viv Cole at the office. This project is financed by Heritage Lottery Fund. There was a huge response to the Forest Schools activities held at half term. These will be held again during the Easter holidays on the following dates: 4thApril from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. for over 8s. On 12thApril from 10 a. m. to 12 noon, there will be a Teddy Bears' Picnic for the under 8s. All these must be booked in advance. Finally, don't forget the Easter Egg Roll on Bank Holiday, 9thApril, starting at 11 a.m. Bring your own hard-boiled and decorated egg to roll down the hill in the woods. The first past the finishing line will win a large chocolate egg! This year, due to popular demand, there will also be an Adults' Easter Egg Roll following the children's competition.

728,"Although man has known asbestos for hundreds of years, it was not until 160 years ago that it was mined for the first time on the North American continent. H.W.Johns, owner of a New York City Supply Shop for roofers,was responsible for the opening of that first mine. Mr. Johns was given a piece of asbestos which had been found in Italy. He experimented with the material and then showed its surprising powers to his customers. After putting on a pair of asbestos gloves,which looked much like ordinary work gloves,he took red-hot coals from the fireplace and played with them in his hands. How astonished the customers were to discover that he was not burned at all. You can well imagine that he had increased business in asbestos roofing materials. However,because it was very expensive to transport them from Italy to the United States, Mr. Johns sent out a young scientist to seek a source nearer home. This young man found great vein, in the province of Quebec in Canada. Ever since 1881 Quebec has led the world in the production of this unusual mineral,which is made up of magnesium, silicon, iron, and oxygen. When it is mined, the asbestos is heavy, just as you would expect a mineral to be. When it is separated,a strange thing happens; the rock breaks down into fine, soft, soapy fibers.     Scientists do not know why the rock can be separated easily into threads ,but they have found thousands of uses of this fireproof material, of the so- called ""cloth of stone.""

729,"Advertising can be a service to the customer. This is true when advertisements give reliable information about the goods advertised. Such information is needed if the customer is to make a sensible choice when he buys. It is useful in that it lets him know of the kinds of goods in the shops. Printed advertisements do this job best. Customers can collect them and compare them. They can be taken along to shops and their claims can be checked against the actual goods in the shops. however, some advertisements are not very useful to the customer. Instead of helping him to satisfy his real needs, they set out to make him want things. They set out to create a need. These advertisements are cleverly done. The people who produce them understand our weaknesses. They set out to make us believe that what they advertise will make us cleverer, prettier and more handsome, if only we use it. Actually, it is our money they are after and we should be on guard. Some advertisements mislead customers by using part of the truth to suggest something false, and it is skillfully made to give that idea to the careless reader, listener or viewer. At its best advertising can be useful to the customer. At its worst it can mislead him. Many newspapers check on the goods for which the advertisements made claims. Most newspapers are very careful about the small advertisements, which try to sell goods directly to the readers by post. Many newspapers print information about this on their small advertisement pages. Advertising has become a very big business, and good firms in it do all they can to make sure it is conducted with some attention to truth. This is a help to the customer. But the best way is for customers to be on the lookout.

High technology, some predicted, would make team work a thing of the past. That's happening in those areas of business and data processing where one person and a computer can replace a team of workers. But, elsewhere, teamwork is very much alive. High technology has led to a new type of teamwork in a number of fields, including advertising, scientific research, engineering design, architecture and ocean exploration. Through computer networking, scientists, engineers and technicians at different locations---often thousands of miles apart---can work on the same project at once. They can exchange ideas, try out different designs and test their results. Examples? An engineering team can now design and try out a robot system, a new manufacturing process, or an entire factory before it is built. An architectural team can do the same with a building or a bridge. A medical team can simulate   a dangerous operation before performing it on a patient. Of course, computer-assisted team effort doesn't end with investigation and simulation. It now usually continues into actual design, manufacturing and testing. ""Computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacture (CAM) are breaking down barriers between traditional design and manufacturing functions,"" explains Dr. Prakash Rao, an engineering manager at General Electric. ""Interdisciplinary teams and engineers follow a product from concept to production. Everything is interconnected like a network."" Sometimes a computer-aided effort can extend beyond production.

Being out of high school meant I finally grew up. Soon I would be on my own, making my own decisions, doing what I was interested in without someone looking over my shoulder  .     There was never any question in my mind that I would go to college. But which college I would attend seemed like a never-ending list of unknowns: What would college be like?  Would I make friends easily? Would I miss my family so much that I wouldn't be able to stand it? What if the college I selected turned out to be a terrible mistake?     Then panic set in.  My feelings took a 180-degree mm. I really didn't want to leave high school at all. It had been nice being respected as a Senior by the underclass students for the past year; I didn't enjoy the idea of being on the bottom of the ladder again.     Despite months of expectation, nothing Could have prepared me for the impact of the actual day. As the familiar tune of ""Pomp and Circumstance"" echoed   in the background, tears welled up uncontrollably in my eyes, and I was consumed by a rush of sadness. I rose from my seat when I heard my name called and slowly crossed the stage to receive my diploma. As I reached out my hand, I knew that I was reaching not just for a piece of paper but for a new life. Exciting as the future of a new life seemed, it wasn't easy to say goodbye to the old  _ -- the familiar faces, the' familiar routine.

Impulsively , I hade pushed Mr. Ford, my math teacher, down a flight of steps at school. He broke his arm in two places. Anyway, he had agreed not to accuse me as a favour to my dad, who was in the middle of a tight race for sheriff  in our town. But my _ behaviour had my dad's closest advisor talking.

However, teeth are hurt easily to problems and disease. September 20 is National Teeth-loving Day in China. Let's pay attention to the health of our teeth. Teeth problems are common around the world. Most children and young adults have tooth decay . A study which come out on China Health Monthly magazine this year showed that 40.74% of a sample of 1,306 Chinese students under age 15 has decayed teeth. Food that is rich in sugar increases the risk of tooth decay. After you eat, bacteria go crazy over the sugar on your teeth. The bacteria turn sugar into acids that eat away at tooth enamel. This causes holes in your teeth. Another common problem is crooked teeth . When your new teeth begin to grow and the old teeth haven't fallen out, there isn't enough space for the new ones. This causes crooked teeth. Don't worry. Here are some ways to keep your teeth healthy. *Brush at least twice a day in the morning and in the evening. *Learn to use dental floss . The floss gets rid of food that's hidden where your toothbrush can't get it. *Visit a dentist.

Venice grew out of small islands in saltwater lakes when some Italians escaped from a war more than 1,500 years ago, and built homes there. Water makes the city special, but it is also a big problem. Once, people used too much underground water. This made the city get lower little by little. Now the city has gone down by 23 centimeters. Another problem is the rising seawater. The temperature has risen over the years. This has made the ice of the Arctic Ocean   melt  . Every year, high waters hit the city in autumn and winter.

738,"How good are you at saying ""no""? For many, it's surprisingly difficult. This is especially true of editors, who by nature tend to be eager and engaged participants in everything they do. Consider these scenes: It's late in the day. That front-page package you've been working on is nearly complete; the last editing and it's finished. Then enters the chief editor, who makes a suggestion requiring a more-than-modest rearrangement of the design and the addition of an information box. You want to scream: ""No! It's done!"" What do you do? The first rule of saying no to the boss is ""don't say no"". He probably has something in mind when he makes the suggestion, and it's up to you to find out what. The second rule is ""don't raise the risks by challenging his authority"". That issue is already decided. The third rule is ""be ready to put forward choices and consequences"". The boss's suggestion might be appropriate, but there are always consequences. He might not know about the pages backing up that need attention, or about the designer who had to go home sick. Tell him he can have what he wants, but explain the consequences. Understand what he's trying to accomplish and propose a Plan B that will make it happen without destroying what you've done so far. Here's another case. Your least-favorite reporter suggests a silly story idea. This one should be easy, but it's not. If you say no, even politely, you risk holding back further ideas, not just from that reporter, but from others who heard that you turned down the idea. This case is common in newsrooms that lack a systematic way to filter story suggestions. Two steps are necessary. First, you need a system for how stories are proposed and reviewed. Reporters can bear rejection of their ideas if they believe they are given a fair hearing. Your natural reaction and strong rejection, even of a worthless idea, might not qualify as systematic or fair. Second, the people you work with need to make a ""What if"",agreement covering ''What if my idea is turned down?"" How are people expected to react? Is there an appeal process? Can they perfect the idea and resubmit it? By imagining ""What if...?"" situations before they happen, you can reach understanding that will help ease you out of opposition.

739,"Eating foods high in trans-fats(fats present in artificial form in industrially-produced cakes and fast food...) and saturated   fats increases the risk of depression, according to a Spanish study, confirming previous studies that linked ""junk food"" with the disease. Researchers also showed that some products, such as olive oil, can fight against the risk of mental illness. Authors of the wide-reaching study, from the universities of Navarra and Las Palmas, followed and analyzed the diet and lifestyle of over l2,000 volunteers over six years. When the study began, none of the participants had been diagnosed with depression; by the end, 657 of them were new sufferers. ""Participants with an increased consumption of trans-fats presented up to a 48 percent increase in the risk of depression when they were compared to participants who did not consume these fats,"" the head study author said. ""The more trans-fats were consumed, the greater harmful effect they produced in the volunteers."" The research team found, at the same time, that after assessing the effect of polyunsaturated fats made up of larger amounts of fish and vegetable oils and olive oil, these products are associated with a lower risk of suffering depression. The report, published in the online journal PLOS ONE, noted the research was performed on a European population that enjoys a relatively low intake of trans-fats--making up only 0.4 percent of the total energy taken in by the volunteers. ""Despite this, we observed an increase in the risk of suffering depression of nearly 50 percent,"" said researcher Miguel Martinez. ""On this basis we think it of great importance to take this effect into account in countries like the United States, where the percentage of energy _ from these fats is around 2.5 percent."" The report pointed out that the current number of depression sufferers in the world is around l50 million people, and has increased in recent years. This rise is attributable, according to the authors, ""to great changes in the sources of fats consumed in Western diets, where we have replaced certain types of beneficial fats in nuts, vegetable oils and fish with the saturated and trans-fats found in meats, butter and other products such as mass-produced cakes and fast food.""

741,"The US government has started a website, Admongo, to help children think critically about the advertising aimed at them. It claims to provide visitors with an ""education"" through games and other amusement. A cartoon man dressed in old time pilot clothing greets visitors to Admongo. ""Call me Haiz"", he says upon arrival in a rocket ship that opens up with a crazy world inside it. Spacey dance music plays in the background as Haiz tells visitors that they need to learn about advertising. Its inventors say eight to twelve years old is the age kids develop their critical thinking abilities. Kids that age are also a big market for advertisers. The idea behind Admongo is to teach children three things: To _ the advertiser. To know what the advertiser is really saying. And to know what the advertisement is trying to get the child to do. Children learn these things through a video game. They create their own game character. They can choose different skin colors, hair styles, eye and mouth shapes. Then they begin a trip through ad-land, where there are ads on buses and billboards. The players have to find all the marketing in the neighborhood before they can move on to the next level. The Admongo game takes players inside a home, to the advertising studio and everywhere else ads can be found. It is a complete exploration of the world of marketing. One such area is food marketing. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says it is a big business. The FTC estimates that food, drink and fast-food restaurants spent more than one and a half billion dollars on advertising to young people in 2010. The FTC says children are important for three reasons. They buy products. They influence parents and caregivers to buy. And they are the future adult buyers of the products. A recent study says most advertising aimed at children is for foods of the lowest nutritional value.

Private companies own the trucks. They travel around the city every day to sell water - at very high prices. ""A lot of people can't afford it,"" she said. The average person in Yemen uses 100 to 200 cubic meters of water per year. That is far below the international water poverty line of 1,000 cubic meters.

744,"Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft and one of the richest people in the world, is now making efforts to reinvent  the toilet. Gates has donated a big part of his wealth to charity. Now his charitable organization, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is looking for future toilets that can improve the living conditions of millions of people. The flush toilet  we use today was invented in 1775. While it works well in getting rid of our waste, it also uses a lot of water and needs a costly sewage system . Besides, it's not necessarily practical for the developing world. In some developing countries, lack of toilets leads to poor hygiene ,and _ could kill people. According to the World Health Organization, 1.5 million children under the age of five die each year because of hygiene problems. Last year, the Gates Foundation gave money to eight universities around the world and asked them to start inventing the toilet of tomorrow: a toilet that uses little or no water is cheap and easy to fix, and is safe and hygienic. At the "" Reinvent the Toilet Fair "" competition recently held in Seattle, twenty-eight designs were displayed. The winners, from the California Institute of Technology , were awarded a $ 100,000 prize by the Gates Foundation. ""We couldn't be happier with the response that we've gotten,"" Bill Gates said at the event. Many of the new designs would not only greatly improve hygiene in the developing world, but also help change the dependence on traditional flush toilets in developed nations, he said. How many designs were displayed at the ""Reinvent the Toilet Fair""?",Eight.,Eighty.,Eighteen.,Twenty-eight.,D
745,"A team of researchers in the UK has shown that children who were taken to the library more often and owned more books at two years old achieved higher scores in school tests when they began primary school. The research also showed that although social background has a noticeable effect on a child's readiness for school, attending pre-school and having their parents teach them a wide range of activities have a positive effect---while extended exposure to television lowers their scores. ""One message coming through loud and clear is that how a child learns in his very early years is critical   for a smooth transition into the educational system,"" said Professor James Law. ""This is a very positive message, as it gets us away from the belief that a child's educational future is pre-determined by standard measures of socio-economic disadvantage, such as income, housing, or the mother's education."" Data from the study shows that children from a positive communication environment had a better expressive vocabulary by their second birthday. These children went on to achieve higher scores in language, reading and maths tests when they entered school. In the early years, the communication environment was a better predictor of children's success with language than their general social background. Most children develop speech and language effortlessly, but some are slow to acquire these skills and go on to struggle with literacy   and academic skills throughout their schooling. This project set out to uncover what factors contributed to these problems. Professor Sue Roulstone said, ""These findings are an encouragement to all parents to provide a positive communication environment for their children from the very start of their lives. The project did identify particular aspects of the communication environment, such as having children's books around and not having the television on too much. But the main message is that, as parents, we can have an impact on how our children learn to talk by providing a range of communication experiences. And the better our children are at talking by the age of two years, the better they will do when they start school."" What is implied in the passage?   _  .",The research could help children who suffer from learning difficulties.,Parents should take their children to school as early as possible.,Teachers should teach children how to communicate with their parents.,Children who have good language abilities will not have difficulties in class.,A

On one-way, multiple lanes  road, the right-most lane would be slowest and left-most lane is fastest. Hand Signals Though indicators  are used for the purpose of showing which direction you are going, knowing some hand signals is very important and are usually always asked in a driving test. When you want to turn right, you can put your left hand out of the window and point upward. When you want to make a left turn, you can reach your left arm out of the window and point to the left. If you want to slow down or stop, you can just point downward. School Buses Yellow school buses have flashing red lights and stop signs that reach out from the driver's side. The drivers use these warning signals when letting pupils on and off. No matter which side of the road you are traveling on, if you come upon a school bus with its lights flashing and a stop sign used, you must stop. It's the law. Remain stopped until the lights stop flashing or the stop sign is removed. Using the Horn Using horns is not common in America. Actually they are very rarely used.

748,"Moral science is taught as a subject in most schools but with little effect. Perhaps part of the problem lies in the fact that morality is not a science, strictly speaking. It is too much of a social phenomenon, and also has too much of the personal and subjective things mixed within. Besides, morality itself changes with generations. So it is impossible to be defined in a textbook. I remember sitting through forty minutes of moral lessons, which told stories about little children who never told lies and were rewarded for their goodness. It had little effect and left no impression on me, though. If moral science has to be taught as a subject in schools, it needs a participatory  approach. When you tell a child about morals, you also have to deal with social norms and cultural differences. You have to explain that morality can be subjective, and be able to co-exist in society. You will probably have to refer to the morals of the present time. The best way to tell a child how to live is to show him what is valued. If a child likes his friend, you have to make the child think about why. Once the child notices and recognizes goodness in others, he or she is likely to develop it as well. In fact, children learn most of their morals by watching people around them. They absorb behavior patterns from teachers and older students. They watch to see what is rewarded and who is punished. They learn on the sports field and through social work. Moral science lessons should simply consist of letting them live and interact, and watch you support correct values and reward good behavior. When you tell a child about morals, you should  _  .",teach him to share personal moral ideas with others,tell him about social norms and cultural differences,explain that nobody can influence his moral ideas.,say that the present morals are likely to be changed.,B

750,"An extinct mountain goat that was once common in the Pyrenees became the first animal to be brought back from extinction. Researchers used frozen DNA to produce a clone, but the newborn kid died within minutes of birth due to breathing difficulties. The Pyrenean ibex is a type of mountain goat,which is believed to have died out completely in 2000. Before the death of the last known individual(a13-year-old female known as Celia), biologists took cells from her skin and ears. An earlier cloning attempt to use the skin cells failed. But the latest attempt involved the creation of 439 cloned embryos. Of these cloned embryos, 57 were put into the female domestic goats, but only one goat gave birth and the newborn cloned kid died after seven minutes as a result of lung disease. Researchers say that other cloned animals, including sheep, have been born with similar lung disease, but they say that overall the experiment was a major step forward in the effort to bring the ibex back to its mountain home. The leading researcher Jose Folch says, ""the cloned kid was genetically like the ibex;in species such as the ibex,cloning is the only possibility to avoid its complete disappearance."" The failure to produce a living clone from DNA that was frozen only a decade ago shows the difficulty researchers would face in trying to bring back species that have been extinct  for decades or centuries. Researchers have had the idea of bringing back the Tasmanian tiger, which went extinct in 1936. There are, however, other species that have been seriously suggested for cloning,such as the giant panda, the African bongo antelope, the Sumatran tiger and the pygmy hippo. Supporters believe cloning provides hope of keeping these endangered animals alive before they die out. Jose Foleh would agree that cloning  _  .",is not suitable and should be banned.,requires immediate attention.,should be carried out cautiously.,may help prevent animal extinction.,D
751,"Climate change, global warming, the greenhouse effect ... these days nobody denies that there is something strange and worrying happening to the atmosphere. Scientists are puzzled by the rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. They are afraid that the world may be a short way from what they refer to as uncontrolled global warming. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, meteorologists  have been carefully monitoring the amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere for the past 50 years. Until recently, there has been a gradual increase of around 1.5 parts per million (ppm). In 2013 the figure rose to 2.08 ppm and in the following year they registered an increase of 2.54 ppm. .Climate analysts feel that it istoo soon to draw conclusions about the phenomenon although the public are concerned that the carbon dioxide emissions are getting out of control. Jason Samenow, the chief meteorologist in the American National Weather Service,thinks that instead of having decades to find a solution to the problem, people might have only a few years. He believes that the Earth's natural systems for absorbing the gas are breaking down resulting in the uncontrolled green house effect. He insists that this is something that could happen if the Earth'stemperatures rose to such a degree that it was unable to contain the heat. . One interesting aspect of this climate change ng down resulting in the uncontrolled greenhouse effect. He insists that this is something that could happen if the Earth's temperatures rose to such a degree that it was unable to contain the heat.is that it is not happening in a uniform way around the world. Carbon dioxide levels in the South Pole are noticeably lower. This suggests that something has happened in the northern hemisphere that set off the rise. Forest fires in North America might hold the answer to the puzzle, along with very hot summers in Europe. The 2014 heat wave was certainly out of the ordinary. Statistics claim that more than 30,000 people lost their lives as a direct result of the high temperatures. Scientists are being cautious in their interpretations. Most feel that it is too soon to say that a new trend has been set. All agree that the phenomenon needs to be closely observed. How will scientists deal with the high temperatures?",By observing the phenomenon closely.,By giving a solution directly.,By experiencing high temperatures personally.,By setting a new trend soon.,A
752,"As the saying goes, man struggles upwards; water flows downwards. Water runs downhill from mountaintops to streams to rivers to oceans. But downhill isn't the only way that water moves .A new study measures how water travels from country to country for human consumption. This flow isn't the type we usually think about .These scientists looked at the water used to grow and make the products which get shipped from nation to nation as imports or exports. They call this a flow of ""virtual water "". We typically think about water as the liquid that flows from a tap. However,92%of the water used by people goes into growing crops,according to water researcher Arjen Hoekstra. He recently studied the hidden travels of virtual water used in products made from things like crops and meats .These products are shipped around the world. For example, consider a sugary soft drink. Hoekstra estimated that to produce one half-liter of the drink requires between 170 and 310liters of the water--about 95%--is used to grow and process the ingredients .Another 4%goes into the packaging and labeling. In Hoekstra's calculation, when one country produces a half-liter of soda and sells it abroad,it exports as much virtual water as would fill a large refrigerator. According to Hoekstra's new report,dry countries like Israel and Kuwait,both in the Middle East,get the majority of their virtual water from other countries,through imported products. More surprisingly, some wetter countries,like the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, also get the majority of their virtual water from other places. That means that most of the water used to grow or produce the products and food consumed in those countries came from other countries. In the United States most of the virtual water used comes from American sources .In China even less of the water associated with its products. In which countries does most part of virtual water come from outside?   _",Kuwait and the Netherlands,China and the United Kingdom,America and the Netherlands,Israel and America,A
753,"Even before historian Joseph Ellis became a best-selling author, he was famous for his vivid lectures. In his popular courses at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, he would often make classroom discussion lively by describing his own fighting experience in Vietnam. But as Ellis's reputation grew--his books on the Founding Fathers won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize ---the history professor began to entertain local and national reporters with his memories of war. Last year, after The Boston Globe reported Ellis's experience in the Vietnam war, someone who knew the truth about Ellis  _ Last week The Boston Globe revealed that Ellis, famous for explaining the nation's history, had some explaining to do about his own past. ""Even in the best of lives, mistakes are made,"" said Ellis. It turned out that while the historian had served in the Army, he'd spent his war years not in the jungles of Southeast Asia , but teaching history at West Point ( ). He'd also overstated his role in the antiwar movement and even his high-school athletic records. His admission shocked colleagues, fellow historians and students who wondered why someone so successful would beautify his past. But it seems that success and truthfulness don't always go hand in hand.  Even among the successful achievers, security experts say, one in ten is deceiving. And, oddly, people often beautify their past once they're famous, says Ernest Brod of Kroll Associates, which has conducted thousands of background checks. Then what makes them do it? Psychologists say some people succeed, at least in part, because they are uniquely adjusted to the expectations of others. And no matter how well-known, those people can be haunted ( ) by a sense of their own shortcomings. ""From outside, these people look anything but fragile,"" says Dennis Shulman, a psychoanalyst.

764,"DALLAS - A suburban Dallas woman accused of killing her two young children told a 911 operator that she first tried to poison them because they were autistic  and she wanted ""normal kids,"" then choked  them with a wire until they stopped moving, according to the recorded call. Irving police on Wednesday released recordings of the 911 call after Saiqa Akhter was charged with capital murder in the death of her 5-year-old son, Zain Akhter and her 2-year-old daughter, Faryaal Akhter. Police said the children were attacked at the family's apartment Monday night. In the recording released Wednesday, the woman identified herself as Saiqa Akhter and repeatedly told the operator she killed her two children. At one point, the woman hung up and the dispatcher  called her back. ""I killed both of them. I told you,"" she told the operator. Later, she explained that both children were lying motionless on the bed in the master bedroom. ""They are not doing anything. They are just blue and they are not taking any breaths and ... their heart is not beating,"" she said. She told the operator she initially tried to poison the children with bathroom cleaner but they refused to drink it. When that didn't work, ""I used a wire on their necks,"" she said. When the operator asked the woman why she attacked her children, she said, ""They're both not normal, not normal. They're autistic. Both are autistic."" Pressed further, she said, ""I don't want my children to be like that. ... I want normal kids."" Later, the dispatcher asked the woman what she was feeling. ""Nothing,"" she responded. At one point, water could be heard running in the background and the dispatcher asked what the woman what she was doing. She told the operator she was trying to wash the smell of cleaner off of her hands. The dispatcher then told the woman to go sit on a couch in the living room and wait for police.

766,"Although hurricane season doesn't begin until June 1, a Pacific storm has already struck. El Salvador, which was ruined by a Caribbean storm in 1995, was hit by Hurricane Adrian on Friday. This is the first Pacific-born hurricane to ever reach land in this Central American country.  Some 14,000 people left from the western coast of El Salvador. The storm weakened as it crossed land, heading east. Heavy rains created deadly flooding problems in the hurricane' s wake.  Adrian is the first Pacific storm of the season. It reported maximum continuous winds of 75 miles per hour, the minimum strength of a hurricane. A Category 3 hurricane, Adrian also caused damage and flooding in Honduras. It is expected to break up before reaching the Caribbean Sea on the eastern coast of Central America.  Hurricane season typically begins June 1 and lasts through November 30. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has predicted   seven to nine hurricanes for the 2005 season.  ""It is difficult to make any kind of an exact prediction of how many of these will strike land,"" NOAA administrator Conrad Lautenbacher said. He predicts two to three hurricanes will strike the U.S. this season.  Last year, six of nine hurricanes reached Category 3 strength or higher. Four of those hit Florida within a six-week period. Altogether, Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne caused more than $40 billion in damage in the Sunshine State.  This year' s forecast is based on ocean temperatures. Warmer temperatures produce more tropical storms, which can then turn into hurricanes.  ""The issue, really, this year is the unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic,"" said Frank Lepore of the National Hurricane Center. We can infer that warmer ocean temperatures   _  .",have nothing to do with the hurricane,cause less hurricane,are mo re likely to cause the hurricanes,do a lot of damage to the areas along the coast,C
767,"iPhone 6, which many people have been thirsty for, will be unveiled  on September 9. It could go on sale to the public from Friday, September 19. Apple has launched a new iPhone every year since it unveiled the range in 2007, selling more than 500 million units since then, and has traditionally launched key products in September. The iPhone 6, Apple's ninth iPhone model, is expected to be released in two different sizes:4.7-inches and 5.5-inches. The smaller of the two will be available first. Like iPhone5, the new model will come in silver , gold and space grey. The iPhone 6 will be powered by new operating system iOS 8. Through iOS8, users will be able to monitor  their health and fitness via HealthKit. HealthKit puts together numerous healthcare and fitness apps, such as blood pressure and heart rate monitors through partners including Nike, and allows them to communicate with each other. Users will be able to control home appliances and other connected devices through HomeKit, Apple's connected home framework. Similar to HealthKit, this app will organize your smart devices to control them in one place. One method of control will be via Siri-for example, you could tell Siri you were ""going to bed"", and it could dim the lights, lock your doors, close the garage door and set the room temperature. With the introduction of both of these key features, it's likely the iPhone 6 will take on even more of a lifestyle device role. It is designed to organize our lives and make everyday tasks easier and more efficiently completed. Suppliers are believed to be preparing to produce up to 80m of the new handsets by the end of December, according to the Wall Street Journal. In July, Apple announced strong financial results for its third quarter, with significant sales growth in China and profits ahead of expectations at $7.7bn.

768,"Teenagers around the world can be glad with the news that their brain deserves the blame when parents' orders go ignored while they tap on their smartphones. A new scientific study from the University College London has found that humans may suffer temporarily deaf when they're simultaneously focusing on something visual. Research found that the 13 volunteers experienced inattentional deafness to the normal-volume sounds playing in the background as their visual tasks became increasingly difficult. 'We found that when volunteers were performing the demanding visual task, they were unable to hear sounds that they would normally hear,' study co-author Maria Chait said in a statement. 'The brain scans showed that people were not only ignoring or filtering out the sounds, they were not actually hearing them in the first place.' The findings, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, suggest that the visual and auditory processing centers that make sense of the sights and sounds that surround us share limited resources. Inattentional deafness is a common everyday experience and the study explains why, according to UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience Professor Nilli Lavie, a co-author of the study. 'This could also explain why you might not hear your bus or train stop being announced if you're concentrating on your phone, book, or newspaper. ''If you try to talk to someone focusing on a book, game, or television program and don't receive a response, they are not necessarily ignoring you, they simply might not hear you! ' she said. Loud sounds--like ambulance sirens--will still be able to break through, but some situations could become potentially dangerous when the quieter ones go unheard, according to Medical Daily. 'This has more serious implications in situations such as the operating theater, when a surgeon concentrating on their work might not hear the equipment beeping,' Lavie said. 'It also applies to drivers concentrating on complex directions as well as cyclists and motorists who are focusing intently on something such as an advertisement or even simply an interesting-looking passerby.

777,"Long ago, little attention was paid to a person's birthday. Even though everyone knew that people grew older, they had no way of correctly marking time. It wasn't until the early people learned more about how time passed that they made a note of time changes. Then they developed a calendar and began to celebrate special events such as birthdays. When birthdays first started to be celebrated during the early days, common people, especially children, hardly celebrated their birthdays.     Today, birthdays are celebrated by the young and the old alike all around the world. Many countries have different customs from ours of celebrating birthdays. At the same time there are a lot of people that celebrate birthdays in quite similar ways as we do. Some of the countries are very similar to the United States, such as Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden and Switzerland.     Customs within countries can be affected by things like language, religion, geographic location, and economic conditions. No matter what the customs are, however, they are always followed by the majority of the people in each country. For example, not all children in the US have birthday parties, candles or birthday cakes, but most of them do. However, the reasons why we celebrate birthdays and use different symbols are very much the same to everyone. The reason why we have birthday parties goes back to long time ago. At that time people believed that good and bad spirits appeared when a child was born and influenced that child through his / her life. The belief brought about the custom of having birthday parties. They believed that surrounding the birthday person with friends, family and good wishes would frighten the bad spirits away. At first, people had birthday parties to   _  .",get rid of bad luck,bring good luck,honor the important day,express their wishes,A
778,"Botany   , the study of plants, occupies a particular position in the history of human knowledge.For many thousands of years it was the one field of awareness about which humans had anything more than the vaguest  ) of insights.It is impossible to know today just what our Stone Age ancestors knew about plants, but from what we can observe of pre-industrial societies that still exist, a detailed learning of plants and their properties must be extremely ancient.This is logical.Plants are the basis of the food pyramid for all living things even for other plants.They have always been enormously important to the welfare of people not only for food but also for clothing, tools, medicines, shelter, and a great many other purposes.Tribes living today in the jungle of the Amazon recognize hundreds of plants and know many properties of each.To them, botany has no name and is probably not even recognized as a special branch of ""knowledge"" at all. Unfortunately, the more industrialized we become, the farther away we move from direct contact with plants, and the less distinct our knowledge grows.Yet everyone comes unconsciously on an amazing amount of botanical knowledge, and few people will fail to recognize a rose or an apple.When nor Neolithic ancestors, living in the Middle East about 10,000 years ago, discovered that certain grasses could be harvested and their seeds planted for richer fields the next season--the first, great step in a new association of plants and humans was taken.Grains were discovered and from them flowed the wonder of agriculture: cultivated crops.From then on, humans would increasingly take their living from the controlled production of a few plants, rather than getting a little here and a little there from many varieties that grew wild, and the accumulated knowledge of tens of thousands of years of experience with plants in the wild would begin to fade away.

780,"Have you ever wondered why birds sing? Maybe you thought that they were just happy. After all, you probably sing or whistle when you are happy.    Some scientists believe that birds do sing some of the time just because they are happy. However, they sing most of the time for a very different reason. Their singing is actually a warning to other birds to stay out of their territory.    Do you know what a 'territory' is? A territory is an area that an animal, usually the male, claims   as its own. Only he and his family are welcome there. No other families of the same species  are welcome. Your yard and house are your territory where only your family and friends are welcome. If a stranger enter your territory and threaten you, you may shout. Probably this is enough to frighten him away.    If so, you have actually scared the stranger away without having to fight him. A bird does the same thing. But he expects an outsider almost any time, especially at nesting season. So he is screaming all the time, whether he can see an outsider or not. This screaming is what we call a bird's song, and it is usually enough to keep an outsider away.    Birds sing loudest in the spring when they are trying to attract a mate and warn others not to enter the territory of theirs.    You can see that birds have a language of their own. Most of it has something to do with attracting mates  and setting up territories. What is a bird's 'territory'?",A place where families of other species are not accepted.,A place where a bird may shout at the top of its voice.,An area for which birds fight against each other.,An area which a bird considers to be its own.,D

783,"Liah Kaminer remembers hearing the shock from the audience when two seniors rapped the words ""raise your hand like a Nazi"" at a school assembly during her sophomore year. It wasn't the only instance of anti-Semitism   that Kaminer, 17, of Hall High School in Connecticut, says she witnessed at her school. There were other comments, like a boy asking two other students in her class if they were Jewish. When they replied that they weren't, he said, ""Oh, good."" Kaminer recalled. He patted them on their backs and said, ""You're one of us."" Kaminer, who is Jewish, said she was hurt by the remark, and after a while she got tired of seeing such comments swept under the rug .

After reaching out to the administration and connecting with social studies department supervisor Stephen Armstrong, Kaminer and Armstrong put together a class on anti-Semitism. They presented it to every ninth-grade social studies class during the last week of school this year.

They had class discussions about what stereotypes  students had heard. ""I was a little surprised and confused by how much of this still goes on at Hall."" Armstrong said. ""That's why we're doing this. Although students are taught about the Holocaust   in history classes, it's a pity that kids are seldom asked to think about this topic in a present-day situation."" ""The fact that a teenager was teaching her fellow students made the class more effective."" Armstrong said. ""I could have done it - a couple of classes I did it myself - but it was a lot more effective when a kid was with me. It wasn't just some teacher talking.

If you do not finish high school, you make only $10,800 a year. You can make $7,800 more each year by staying in high school! If you stay in school, then you can make more money. A person with a high school degree makes about $18,600 a year. If that person goes to college and gets a bachelor's degree  , he can make $42,000. With a master's degree  , he can make about $53,000. If the person gets a PhD  , he can make almost $79,000 or more a year. We can learn a very important thing from this information. If you want to work and make more money, get a good education.

788,"LAST week, the College Board announced that it was revising the SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) in an effort to make it more acceptable to test-takers, teachers, college admission officers and the public more generally. Test-takers who receive lower scores than they have hoped for are likely to be concerned about their academic future. It's no wonder that it's hard to discuss the test without negative feelings. The SAT isn't perfect. Like any test, it can be misused, and may reflect unequal educational opportunities. Even before the announcement of the SAT's redesign, experts were discussing the test's limitations. Writing in The New Yorker, Elizabeth Kolbert described its questions as limited: ""Critical thinking was never called for, let alone curiosity or imagination."" But the SAT provides an effective measure of a person's ability to reason through verbal  and mathematical materials, a skill required in college. Although there are conflicting reports on the issue, a study published in the journal Educational and Psychological Measurement in 2011 found that the SAT can meaningfully add to the prediction of a student's first-year college academic performance, above his grades in high school alone. The fact that the SAT can help predict this is, to me, an astonishing achievement that cannot be ignored. We cannot afford to ignore tests because they fall short of perfection or make us uncomfortable. But there's a better way to make the SAT more acceptable in the long run: We should expand the types of tests we use so as to more fully reflect what students can do. What if, in addition to the SAT, students were offered new tests that measured more diverse abilities? For future artists or musicians, there are tests that measure creative thinking --a largely ignored ability by the SAT. For future engineers, there are tests that measure their sense of space. And new measures of ""personal intelligence"" -- the ability to reason about a person's motives, emotions and patterns of activities -- may also tell us something important about students' self-knowledge and understanding of others.

789,"A few years ago, pop poets such as Murray Lachlan Young began to set poetry to rock music with some surprising results. People thought that poetry was the new rock 'n' roll. However, despite the brief popularity of a few pop poets, poetry and pop music didn't seem to mix. But are they really so different? If you look back at the origins of poetry, there is a strong connection between poems and popular music. In Greek mythology, for example, the muse   Erato is pictured with a lyre   in her hand, and looks just like the ancestor of the modern rock star with his electric guitar. In addition, the poets Shelley and Byron were as famous in the nineteenth century as the pop stars of today. But despite their common origins, there are many differences between poetry and pop music. Pop songs are always written for a public performance, whereas poetry often isn't. And the lyrics in pop songs sometimes have less rhythm than those in poetry. This is because the music provides the rhythm rather than the words. Pop lyrics are also simpler and often keep on saying the same thing. This repetition works well in a performance and means that pop songs are easier for people to sing and learn by heart. Both songs and poems tell a story or talk about feelings. Songs in particular deal with the different stages in a relationship, such as falling in love or breaking up. The words and ideas in songs are usually easier to understand than those in ""serious"" poetry. However, talented performers like Paul McCartney, or newer stars like Robbe Williams, often give simple songs more expression when they perform them. And some of the best lines from pop lyrics are as beautiful as poetry. So although pop music and poetry have many differences, they do have one important thing in common: the power to make us think about how we feel. What did Murray Lachlan Young do a few years ago?",He had poems and rock music combined.,He surprised people with his beautiful style of writing.,He wrote beautiful music for some famous poems.,He invented a new kind of poem for his fans.,A
790,"The Ministry of Education in Singapore is releasing a new book this month that summarizes the thinking behind the model method for teaching math.The approach has drawn interest from many comers of the world thanks to the country's top performance on international exams.Last night, education officials and researchers from the US and Singapore highlighted some key differences between the two systems. Singapore's method is highly visual and explores fewer topics, but in greater depth.While Singapore's text books have an average of 34 lessons with 15 pages of explanation for each, much bulkier texts in the US include an average of 157 lessons, with about four pages of explanation per lesson.There arc some more surprising differences. Professional development is intensive for all teachers in Singapore, but strangely about half of the elementary teachers do not have university degrees.That is certain to change, though, as education standards for entering teachers are increasing, said Madame Low, the director of curriculum, planning and development with Singapore's Ministry of Education."" Starting salaries for math teachers match public sector accountants or engineers.Teachers are treated as professionals,"" added Madame Low. Mentoring programs for new teachers in Singapore last five years! Teacher evaluations there are extremely comprehensive, and teachers who succeed receive bonuses worth one to three months of salary.Grades one and two have smaller class sizes--only 30 students.Students are taught in English, not their native tongue.Many are bilingual or trilingual. People often ask, how applicable is a successful model in Singapore to the more diverse and much larger US? I'm also interested in the practical challenges.Given that books in the US are written with state standards and assessments in mind, matching them up with another country's approach might be tough.

As usual, our teachers asked us to be prepared. At the end of the day, Mrs Sushila Tyaji, our Hindi teacher, walked in and told us that the inspector had come and quietly observed the class from the back door. He had also left an _ remark! That was sad for us. Would we now be punished for having failed our teachers? There were no answers from Mrs Tyaji. Instead, she wrote the Hindi word ""dukh"" on the blackboard. And then she did something I have never seen a teacher do in my entire school life. She apologized. ""I am sorry for having taught you something wrong,"" she said. ""I missed out the dots between the letters 'du' and 'kh'. The inspector told me this in the staffroom. I hope you will not make this mistake in future."" That admission had a significant effect on me. If our teacher can say sorry to us when she is wrong, why can't I? The incident helped me get rid of two common vices--ego and dishonesty.

793,"With the World Cup always held in the European off-season in June and July, when the tiny nation of Qatar beat out USA Australia, Japan and South Korea, as the venue of the 2022 World Cup Soccer, there were gasps of surprise from the fans - it was not just because of the size of the competitors, but also the fact that Doha sees an average top temperature of 41 degrees Celsius  in June and July with the possibility of top temperatures as high as 50degC. Since the World Cup cannot be moved to the 'cooler' season in January or to a neighboring country with milder weather, Qatar has to figure out a solution to make the game more comfortable. A team of engineering scientists from Qatar University (QU) have taken a more high-tech approach to solving the problem - they've reportedly developed a type of artificial ""cloud"" designed to float above the World Cup venues and provide fans and players with relief from the blazing sun. The artificial clouds system was invented by a team led by Dr Saul Abdul Ghani, Head of the Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department at QU, who told Gulf News that the ""clouds"" would be made from a lightweight carbon structure carrying a giant envelope of material containing helium gas. The ""cloud"" would also feature solar panels on its upper surface to power engines that allow the cloud to be moved via remote control. While the country officials have promised to improve some of the issues with solar-powered stadiums capable of reducing the temperatures inside, to a comfortable 20degC, there is still concern of how the players will be able to function in the practice fields. The system would initially cost around US$500,000, with prices coming down with commercial scale production. However, since Qatar needs to find a solution, the money is probably to the issue. The bigger question is, will this team of scientists actually be able to conjure up something that they have promised? We will all find out in about eleven years!

795,"Today is National Bike-to-Work Day. And on New York City's jammed streets, people are cycling on hundreds of miles of new bike lanes. But New York's widespread efforts to make streets safer for bikes have also left some locals complaining about the loss of parking spots and lanes for cars. When the weather is good, Aaron Naparstek likes to pedal his two young kids to school on a special Dutch-made bicycle. Naparstek supports the new lane. Aaron: The bike lane on Prospect Park West is really introducing a lot of new people to the idea that it's possible to use a bike in New York City for transportation or to travel around. This is what 21stcentury New York City looks like. Prospect Park West is still a one-way road, but where it used to have three lanes of car traffic, now it has two, plus a protected bike lane. Supporters say that makes the road safer for everyone, including pedestrians, by slowing down cars and taking bikes off the sidewalk. But some longtime residents disagree. Lois Carswell is president of a group called Seniors for Safety. She says the two-way bike lane is dangerous to older residents who are used to one-way traffic. Lois: We wanted a lane -- the right kind of lane that would keep everybody safe, that would keep the bikers safe. But we want it to be done the right way. And it has not been done the right way. Craig Palmer builds bars and restaurants in Manhattan. I was interviewing him for a different story when he brought up the bike lanes all on his own. Craig: I think the biggest problem is that Bloomberg put all these bike lanes in. You took what used to be a full street and you're shrinking it. Then there are the Hasidic Jews in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, who forced the city to remove a bike lane through their neighborhood.

796,"More and more birds are flying to settle at Qinghai Lake, one of the highest inland lakes in China, thanks to the protection efforts of local governments. Covering an area of over 4,000 square kilometers, Qinghai Lake is also the country's biggest salt-water lake. Located in Northwest China's Qinghai Province, the lake is famous for the two islands at its northwest point--Cormorant Island and Egg Island. The two islands have plenty of floating grass and various schools of fish, offering rich food sources for birds. The islands have become a paradise for different kinds of groups of birds and have been called 'Bird Islands'. Each March and April, when ice and snow covering the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau starts to melt, over 20 kinds of birds fly to the Bird Islands to lay eggs. During the months, flocks of birds cover the whole sky over the islands and birds eggs can be found everywhere. Visitors can hear the singing of birds from miles away. These have become a world famous symbol of the lake. To protect this paradise for birds and support calls for ecological protection, China set up the Qinghai Lake Natural Protection Zone at the end of 1997. Meanwhile, the State has pointed out the Bird Islands and Spring Bay of the Qinghai Lake as central protection zones. Inspection officials and management employees often patrol the lake, improving local residents' knowledge of related laws and spreading knowledge about animal protection to visitors. They are making great efforts to call on people to love and protect the birds. At the same time, they have built special fences around the island area, to prevent wolves, foxes and other carnivorous animals, as well as illegal hunters from breaking up the birds' nest-building, egg-laying and breeding. As a result, more and more birds are coming to the islands for sheltering and breeding. The officials go around the lake mainly to    _",let the farmers there know the animal protection law,tell the farmers there some knowledge about animal protection.,call on people to love and protect the birds,all of the above,D
797,"A four-year-old girl sees three biscuits divided between a stuffed crocodile and a teddy bear.The crocodile gets two; the bear one.""Is that fair?"" asks the experimenter.The girl judges that it is not.""How about now?"" asks the experimenter, breaking the bear's single biscuit in half.The girl cheers up: ""Oh yes, now it's fair.They both have two."" Strangely, children feel very strongly about fairness, even when they hardly understand it. Adults care about fairness too --- but how much? One way to find out is by using the ultimatum   game, created by economist Werner Guth.Jack is given a pile of money and proposes how it should be divided with Jill.Jill can accept Jack's ""ultimatum"", otherwise the deal is off, and neither gets anything. Suppose Jack and Jill don't care about fairness, just about accumulating cash.Then Jack can offer Jill as little as he likes and Jill will still accept.After all, a little money is more than no money.But imagine, instead, that Jack and Jill both care only about fairness and that the fairest outcome is equality.Then Jack would offer Jill half the money; and Jill wouldn't accept otherwise. What happens when we ask people to play this game for real? It turns out that people value fairness a lot.Anyone offered less than 20-30% of the money is likely to reject it.Receiving an unfair offers makes us feel sick.Happily, most offers are pretty equitable; indeed, by far the most common is a 50-50 split. But children, and adults, also care about a very different sort of (un)fairness, namely cheating.Think how many games of snakes and ladders have ended in arguments when one child ""accidentally"" miscounts her moves and another child objects.But this sense of fairness isn't about equality of outcome: games inevitably have winners and losers.Here, fairness is about playing by the rules. Both fairness-as-equality and fairness-as-no-cheating matter.Which is more important: equality or no-cheating? I think the answer is neither.The national lottery , like other lotteries, certainly doesn't make the world more equal: a few people get rich and most people get nothing.Nevertheless, we hope, it is fair --- but what does this mean? The fairness-as-no-cheating viewpoint has a ready answer: a lottery is fair if it is conducted according to the ""rules"".But which rules? None of us has the slightest idea, I suspect.Suppose that buried in the small print at lottery HQ is a rule that forbids people with a particular surname (let's say, Moriarty).So a Ms Moriarty could buy a ticket each week for years without any chance of success. How would she react if she found out? Surely with anger: how dare the organisers let her play, week after week, without mentioning that she couldn't possibly win! She'd reasonably feel unfairly treated because  _ . To protest  against unfairness, then, is to make an accusation of bad faith.From this viewpoint, an equal split between the crocodile and the bear seems fair because (normally, at least), it is the only split they would both agree to.But were the girl to learn that the crocodile doesn't like biscuits or that the bear isn't hungry, I suspect she'd think it perfectly fair for one toy to take the whole.Inequality of biscuits (or anything else) isn't necessarily unfair, if both parties are happy.And the unfairness of cheating comes from the same source: we'd never accept that someone else can unilaterally  violate agreements that we have all signed up to. So perhaps the four-year-old's intuitions  about fairness is the beginnings of an understanding of negotiation.With a sense of fairness, people will have to make us acceptable offers (or we'll reject their ultimatums) and stick by the (reasonable) rules, or we'll be on the warpath.So a sense of fairness is crucial to effective negotiation; and negotiation, over toys, treats etc, is part of life. The chief factor in preventing unfairness is to   _  .",observe agreements,establish rules,strengthen morality,understand negotiation,A

From her I inherited a curious nature, a sense of adventure, bright red hair. I did not, contrary to her hopes, inherit a talent for the piano. That fact was established beyond doubt after unsuccessful attempts to draw music from me. The piano lessons began when I was four. My mother was convinced that I would be a child Mozart. She found the ideal teacher--Madame Oblenka, a strict Russian woman, whose pursed lips were enough to frighten a wild horse into submission. Madame Oblenka, who expected a little Mozart, was not very delighted to find a little girl banging her fists on the keys. I tried to please her. ""Feel the music,"" she urged. I ""felt"" it and winced    my ear--for what is more unpleasant than a series of wrong notes played continuously? She ""felt"" my music, too, which is why she always left with an angrier expression than when she came. Once, when I was ten, I managed to record one of my own rehearsals  . In order to escape my practice sessions, I would close myself behind the door of the piano room, put on the tape recording, and read until the tape had finished. That method worked for a week, until my mother began to wonder why I always missed the same B-sharp. She knocked on the door, and, receiving no answer, came in to check on me and found that I had fallen asleep while the tape of my performance played on and on. I was twelve when my parents finally acknowledged that my hidden talent was not about to _ any time soon. My mother, refusing to admit defeat, told me to pick another instrument. ""Choose anything you want, Honey,"" she said, assuming that freedom of choice would inspire devotion. I thought long and hard and chose the drums. My parents, sensitive to noise, would be less than overjoyed by a daily bombardment of playing. I imagined my father in his study, cotton wads in his ears. I worked my way through several other instruments before my mother hit on another idea. Maybe I wasn't meant to be an instrumentalist. Realizing that drama might be more suited to my talents, Mom took me to a drama teacher. However, he put me backstage, painting scenery. Once I recovered from my sense of injury, I realized the wisdom of his choice. I loved the active, practical backstage world, and I discovered that I had a knack for constructing and painting. I loved the challenge of taking our scanty   supplies and using them to make something beautiful. Imagining a scene and then seeing it emerge before me--this, to me, was close to magic. I'm a sculptor now, and every day I experience afresh the joy of being fully absorbed in the act of artistic creation. It's a wonderful, blissful   feeling. I realize that my parents, in their misguided attempts to interest me in music, were trying to give me this feeling. And now I feel grateful. Perhaps they went about it in the wrong way, but their hearts were in the right place.

Danielle Nierenberg from the Worldwatch Institute in Washington spent a year visiting twenty-five countries south of the Sahara.

The women feed their families and sell their _ They use the money to send their children to school. Last year, about 925,000,000 people worldwide did not get enough to eat. Half of all people in the world now live in and around cities. Researchers like Ms Nierenberg are looking increasingly at creative ideas to feed those who don't have enough good food to eat. She says there are a lot of lessons that people in the Western world can learn from Africa. And what they are doing can certainly be done in other developing countries. Farmers in the developing world lose between twenty and forty percent of their harvest before it ever reaches market. There are many reasons why food gets wasted. Farmers are without electricity and cold storage. They lack good seeds and fertilizer. They lack good roads. Conditions like these keep small farmers in poverty. Ms Nierenberg says more attention needs to be paid to protecting harvests. She says, ""Given all that we invest in producing food in the first place, we need to devote the same amount of attention to making sure that it is not wasted."" In Nigeria, village processing centers are helping farmers reduce their losses and earn more money. They centers process cassava, a root vegetable, into basic food products. In Uganda, the Worldwatch report says some schools are teaching children how to grow local kinds of crops. And in South Africa and Kenya the report praises the breeding  of local kinds of livestock. These animals may produce less milk or meat than other breeds, but they can survive heat and drought conditions.

Yang works for a software company in Zhongguancun. He dreams of such a life, away from poverty, and that hope has kept him in Beijing for three years since he graduated from university. Soon Yang squeezes his way off the bus to the reality of his life: his home--a 10-square-metre room that costs 550 yuan(81 US dollars) or about one-fifth of his salary in rent every month. It's very cold inside the house as it has no central heating system. He has to stand the long and cold winter. Determined to achieve his dream, Yang says he has changed jobs ""numerous"" times in the past three years and is considering quitting his present job. Yang's frustration over his life as a migrant  is shared by many other graduates that have moved into big cities. Together they have come to be called the ""ant tribe"", a term created by Chinese sociologists to describe the struggles of young migrants, who, armed with their diplomas, flood to big cities in hopes of a better life only to put up with low-paying jobs and poor living conditions. They share every similarity with ants. They live in colonies in crowded areas. They're intelligent and hardworking, yet unknown and underpaid. The term, sociologists have said, also reflects their helplessness in a world governed by the law of the concrete jungle--only the strongest survive. A survey in Ant TribeII found nearly 30 percent of the ""ants"" are graduates of famous key universities--almost three times the percentage of 2009. Most have degrees in popular majors, such as medicine, engineering, economics and management. In addition, 7.2 percent of the ""ants"" have at least a master's degree compared to 1.6 percent in 2009. Most said the economic recovery did not really improve their financial situations, and 66 percent said their incomes fell short of their expectations, the survey also found. For two years, Lian Si, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Chinese and Global Affairs of Peking University, who has studied the phenomenon, led a team of more than 100 graduate students to follow the groups in university towns like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Xi'an. Lian evaluates the total population of the ""ant community"" in major cities at one million across China, with about 100,000 found in Beijing alone. Lian predicts that an increasingly challenging job market will see the ant tribe growing further in number. Another 6.3 million graduates are expected to join migrant workers and other job hunters in what promises to be a fierce labour competition. The ant tribe's embarrassing living situations have become a serious social issue, and the government should develop ""second-and-third-tier cities"" to attract more graduates from big cities. However, ""ants"" expect more study and training opportunities in big cities, which keeps them in positive mindsets despite their situations.

805,"By today's standards, my mobile phone is pretty rubbish. It's a Nokia 1616. If that doesn't mean much to you ( it's not the kind of phone you see advertised on television) ,all you need to know is that it's a small, not very heavy device with which you can send and receive telephone calls and text messages. It also has a very handy torch on the top for when you can't find your keys, or when you drop something on the floor in the cinema. Apart from that, my phone doesn't do much. Well, it has an alarm, and it probably has a calculator and things like that, but it's nothing compared to a smartphone. Why would I want one of those?    I have often been told that the big advantage of having a smartphone is that "" you can do everything with them!"" But when was the last time you saw someone doing ""everything"" with a smartphone? Okay, so they may have an endless list of functions, but generally they are used for checking social networking sites, playing games, and receiving and replying to emails. I'm happy just doing all of those things at home on my laptop.    As far as I can tell, the best thing about having a smartphone is that you can be connected to the internet all the time. Don't get me wrong, I love the internet, but I just don't see the point of constantly being online. I can't remember the last time I received a Facebook update which was so urgent that I had to read it as soon as it appeared, and I can't imagine ever having a job which was so important that I would need to read work-related emails immediately. I would think that if someone needed me urgently, they would just ring me rather than send an email. And my trusty Nokia can manage that.    One of the most peculiar effects of the smartphone is, in my opinion, the newly-found addiction to maps and navigation   systems. Is there anything more boring than knowing exactly where you are all of the time? How do you get to know an area if you don't get lost there a few times? And if you are dependent on online maps, what happens to those great places you find just by chance? You can't exactly find out from google maps the journey from ""here"" to ""that hidden cafe with the tasty-looking cakes"", or to ""that pond next to the church which looks really pretty in the evening sun. "" It is, of course, true that we all occasionally need to be pointed in the right direction, but I find that there are often real life humans you can ask.   There are many benefits of having a very basic mobile phone, like the face that it cost me about twenty pounds, and that I don't have to worry too much about it being stolen. But the main benefit has to be the fact that it provides me with the world's greatest excuse for my bad habits. Whether it's turning up late to events, or getting lost on a trip, or missing buses or trains, or forgetting about an appointment at work. I'm pretty sure I'm covered with the following explanation ""I'm really sorry, but I don't have a smartphone."" To the writer, one benefit of having a basic mobile phone is that    _  .",it can remind him of important appointments,it can often be found back after it is stolen,it can be used as an excuse for his bad habits,it can save him the trouble of catching trains,C

807,"In your opinion,what is the most effective way to deal with pressure?Do you think the measure taken by Tufts University is useful? Tufts University has offered extra help around test time to students. Now they're adopting new stress-fighting methods to help the students, who face a tough job market as well as finishing the term. From free massages  to therapy dog visits, students are getting help during those days before turning in final papers and taking final exams. ""I think these dogs make me happy and give me a nice break between learning, cutting the learning into small pieces,""19-year-old Tufts student Chloe Wong said. She called her first term ""challenging"", because she has spent weeks away from family and friends and was afraid she would lose her cool in her first set of final exams. But they now get chances to relax and play with these lovely dogs that head teacher Michael Bliss brought in for them. They can set down their books and laptops for a chance to the pet. Therapy dogs have long been used to cheer the sick and the elderly up. But the university is accepting the idea as a way of relieving stress and comforting students.

808,"Tea, the most important of English drinks, is a relative latecomer to British shores. Although the custom of drinking tea dates back to the third millennium BC in China, it was not until the mid 17 th century that tea first appeared in England. Afternoon tea was introduced in England by Anna, the seventh Duchess of Bedford, in the year 1840. The Duchess would become hungry around four o'clock in the afternoon. The evening meal in her household was served fashionably late at eight o'clock, thus leaving a long period of time between lunch and dinner. The Duchess asked her servant to bring a tray of tea, bread, butter and cake to her room during the late afternoon. This became a habit of hers and she began inviting friends to join her. This pause for tea became a fashionable social event. During the 1880's upper class and society women would change into long gowns , gloves and hats for their afternoon tea which was usually served in the drawing room between four and five o'clock. Traditional afternoon tea consists of a selection of dainty  sandwiches, scones served with cream and jams. Cakes and pastries  are also served. Tea grown in India or Ceylon is poured from silver teapots into delicate bone china cups. Nowadays, however, in the average suburban home, afternoon tea is likely to be just a biscuit or small cake and a mug of tea, usually produced using a teabag. According to the passage, we can learn that    _   .",Tea appeared in England much earlier than in China,The reason why the Duchess was hungry at 4 p.m. is that dinner time came quite late,"In the suburban home, afternoon tea is also served in a dainty way",Tea grown in India or Ceylon is poured from china teapots into delicate bone silver cups.,B

810,"I usually doubt about any research that concludes that people are either happier or unhappier or more or less certain of themselves than they were 50 years ago.While any of these statements might be true, they are practically impossible to prove scientifically. Still, 1 was struck by a report which concluded that today's children are significantly more anxious than children in the 1950s. In fact, the analysis showed, normal children between 9 and 17 have a higher level of anxiety today than children who were treated for mental illness 50 years ago. Why are America's kids so stressed? The report cites two main causes: increasing physical isolation   brought on by high divorce rates and less involvement in community, and a growing perception that the world is a more dangerous place. Given that _ , adults can still do plenty to help the next generation to cope. At the top of the list,nurturing   is a better appreciation of the limits of individualism. No child is an island. Strengthening social ties helps build communities and protect individuals against stress. To help kids build stronger connections with others, you can pull the plug on TVs and computers. Your family will thank you later.They will then have more time for face-to-face relationships, and they will get more sleep. Limit the amount of virtual   violence your children are exposed to. It's not just video games and movies; children see a lot of murder and crime on the local news. Keep your expectations for your children reasonable. Many highly successful people never attended Harvard or Yale. Make exercise part of your daily routine. It will help you deal with your own anxieties and provide a good model for your kids. Sometimes anxiety is unavoidable,but it doesn't have to ruin your life.

812,"Boxing is a fist fighting sport between two matched combatants   wearing padded gloves. A boxer's primary aim is to land as many blows as possible to the head and torso   of the opponent, using strength and speed to dominate the contest. One of the oldest sports still practiced, boxing dates back to thousands of years ago. Today the sport is popular in many parts of the world and encompasses   both amateur and professional matches. For most of the 20th century boxing attracted huge fan and media attention in the United States. Some boxing champions became legendary, larger-than-life figures, such as Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis, and Muhammad Ali. Criticized to varying degrees throughout its history for its violent nature and high injury rate, boxing has somehow always managed to survive----and even thrive----as a sport. Modern boxing regulations are based upon the 12 rules set out by British boxing officials in the mid-19th century. These rules became known as the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, named after the 8th Marquess of Queensberry, John Sholto Douglas, who sponsored and published them. In addition to in-the-ring rules, modern boxing also has specific regulations regarding eligibility for the fighters themselves. The modern rules for professional and amateur boxing differ, but both types of contests are divided into time periods called rounds. In professional boxing, each round lasts three minutes; in amateur boxing, two minutes. A one-minute rest period between rounds is standard. Amateur contests consist of three rounds; professional contests may consist of up to 12 rounds. A bell is usually sounded by a timekeeper to begin and end each round. A key step in making boxing safer and more respectable was the introduction of gloves, ending brutal bare-knuckle competition. Boxing gloves are heavily padded to soften the impact of the blow and to protect the hands of the boxer. As an added protection, the hands are taped before being placed in the gloves, which are essentially huge mittens. Professional gloves usually weigh between 170 and 226g; amateur gloves average 226 to 340g. Which of the following facts about boxing is NOT mentioned in the passage?",The time set for a round.,The weight of gloves.,The size of boxing rings.,The signal to begin and end each round.,C
813,"We all know that every class has its own rules, like ""No smoking!"", ""No eating!"" and ""No sleeping!"".

Moved with pity, the bird threw her a blade of grass, which supported her like a raft, and thus the ant reached the bank again. While she was resting and drying herself in the grass, she heard a man come near. He was walking along barefooted with a gun in his hand. As soon as he saw the dove, he wished to kill it. He would certainly have done so, but the ant bit him in the foot just as he raised his gun to fire. He stopped to see what had bit him, and the dove immediately flew away.

817,"The classical Chinese theatre developed during the Yuan Dynasty (1206-1368). Plots of Yuan plays came from story cycles made familiar by storytellers. During the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), the drama used the plots of popular novels. Until the 19th century, Chinese drama was not spoken; it was a mixture of music and declamation  . Like the Sanskrit   drama, Chinese drama avoids tragedy as that term is understood in the West. However, it is frequently filled with a feeling of pity and sympathy, often involving the deaths of women. Chinese drama is more social and less concerned with romantic love than the Sanskrit. One's family and country are frequently regarded as more important than the individual. In contrast to the Sanskrit drama, Chinese drama was written for the popular audience, and dramatic performances took place in every village. There are many Chinese plays in existence. Among the  _ of them areThe Injustice Suffered by Dou Eby Guan Hanqing,The Western Chamber by Wang Shifu,The Peony Pavilionby Tang Xianzu, andThe Palace of Eternal Youthby Hong Sheng. In the West, Chinese drama has traditionally been regarded as an entertainment rather than a serious art form. One of the reasons for this judgment is the formlessness of Chinese plays. For example, Hong Sheng's The Palace of Eternal Youth, a play in 49 scenes doesn't have any act divisions. In Chinese drama, no attempt is made at realism. The scenery is symbolic. For instance, a flag represents an army and characters at times directly address the audience. Since the early 19th century, the Beijing opera has been the leading force in the Chinese theatre. After World War I, a realistic, spoken drama, patterned after Western plays, developed. According to the passage, which of the following about Chinese drama is TRUE?",It is constantly full of a feeling of pity and sympathy.,It avoids tragedy just like the Sanskrit drama.,It existed almost in every village for the popular audience.,All of the above.,D

When he opened the door to the basement  , flames exploded out. Donald fled   back upstairs to call 911 but the phone didn't work. When he tried to go downstairs, he was stopped by a wall of flames. He had to use a towel to cover his mouth. His house was three miles off the main road and so well hidden by trees that Donald knew calling for help would be useless. Actually, he didn't even try to do that. About one mile away lived Donald's closest neighbor, Jeremie. When he heard some sounds, Jeremie jumped out of bed, holding a phone and a flashlight, and went towards the noise. He dialed 911 the instant he saw the flames. When he came close to the house, Jeremie knew he'd better wait until rescuers came. But he didn't want Donald to die in the fire. Without hesitation  , he rushed into the house. He shouted, ""Donald, where are you?"" Then he had to run outside to catch his breath. After one more attempt  , he gave up and circled around back. He saw Donald on the second-floor balcony, but there was no way to get to him. Suddenly, he noticed a ladder.

819,"I grew up in a house where the TV was seldom turned on and with one wall in my bedroom entirely lined with bookshelves, most of my childhood was spent on books I could get hold of. In fact, I grew up thinking of reading as natural as breathing and books unbelievably powerful in shaping perspectives by creating worlds we could step into, take part in and live in. With this unshakable belief, I, at fourteen, decided to become a writer. Here too, reading became useful. Every writer starts off knowing that he has something to say, but being unable to find the right ways to say it. He has to find his own _ by reading widely and discovering which parts of the writers he agrees or disagrees with, or agrees with so strongly that it reshapes his own world. He cannot write without loving to read, because only through reading other people's writing can one discover what works, what doesn't and, in the end, together with lots of practice, what voice he has. Now I am in college, and have come to realize how important it is to read fiction. As a law student, my reading is in fact limited to subject matter -- the volume of what I have to read for classes every week means there is little time to read anything else. Such reading made it all the clearer to me that I live in a very small part in this great place called life. Reading fiction reminds me that there is life beyond my own. It allows me to travel across the high seas and along the Silk Road, all from the comfort of my own armchair, to experience, though secondhand, exciting experiences that I wouldn't necessarily be able to have in my lifetime. What can be inferred about the author as a child?",He never watched TV.,He read what he had to.,He found reading unbelievable.,He considered reading part of his life.,D

822,"Statistics show that every year, about 4 million students fail to pass the national college entrance exam. However, as China recently publicized students' scores for this year's college entrance exam, it seems that schools, parents and society at large give more attention to students who succeed in the exam, few people care about those who fail, the China Education Daily reported. Some students, after failing the exam, cannot get a timely support from their parents or teachers and begin to display some serious mental problems. How to help these students to get rid of the shadow on their mind has become a problem to be taken seriously. First, students' friends, parents and relatives should offer their sympathy and care to them in order to comfort their heart. At this time, parents should not blame students for their failure, otherwise they might bear more psychological   burden. Secondly, teachers and the whole society should also offer more support to students who fail the exam. Lastly, students themselves should also try to overcome their depressions and adjust their mood.

823,"An African farmer had heard tales about other farmers who had made millions of dollars by discovering diamond mines. These tales so excited the farmer that he could hardly wait to sell his farm and go prospecting for diamonds himself. So he sold the farm and spent the rest of his life wandering the African continent, searching unsuccessfully for the shining stone that brought such high prices on the markets of the world. Finally, broke and worn out, he threw himself into a river and drowned. Meanwhile, back at the farm, the man who had bought his farm happened to be crossing a small river on the property one day when he saw something shining at the bottom of the river. He picked it up. It was a sparkling stone - a good size stone - and, admiring it, he later put it on his fireplace mantel  as an interesting curiosity. Several weeks later, a visitor admired the stone, looked closely at it, lifted it in his hand and nearly fainted. He asked the farmer if he knew what he'd found. When the farmer said no, that he thought it was just a piece of crystal, the visitor told him he had found one of the largest diamonds ever discovered. The farmer was astonished. He told the man that his small river was full of these brilliant stones, and his farmland was covered with them. Not all were as large, perhaps, as the one on his mantel, but they were sprinkled generously throughout his property.

My earliest memories of my father are a tall, handsome, successful man devoted to his work and his family, but uncomfortable with his children. He seemed to expect too much of me. He seemed unhappy with me unless I got straight A's and unhappy with my boyfriends if their fathers were not as ""successful"" as he was. Whenever I went out with him on weekends, I used to feel very nervous. On the first day of my visit, we went out with one of my father's friends for lunch at an outdoor cafe. We talked along that afternoon, did some shopping, ate on the street table, and laughed over my son's funny facial expressions. Gone was my father's critical   air and strict rules. After my visit to Tucson , My father seemed to be so friendly and gentle. What had held him back before? The next day dad pulled out his childhood pictures and told me quite a few stories about his own childhood.

Army Corps of Engineers upriver, his theory aims to look deeper into the root of the problem. ""The Missouri River is flooding,"" said Dr. James Hansen, Director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, during a visit to Omaha on Tuesday.""We've had floods that usually only happen once in every hundred years a couple of times on the Missouri River recently. That's one of the expected consequences of the increasing level of atmospheric carbon dioxide."" Hansen, who is considered to be one of the world's leading experts on global warming , said the Missouri River is an example of how global warming is affecting the earth .""Unless you do statistics ,and you see that the frequency of these events is changing , it's not so easy to see that changes are occurring , because the climate system has large inertia  ,""he said . Hansen explained, ""The ocean is four kilometers deep, and the ice sheets are two or three kilometers thick , so they don't respond immediately as we begin to change the atmospheric composition .We've only experienced about half of the warming that will be caused by the gases already in the atmosphere .The full effect is going to be felt by our children and grandchildren .And if we continue to increase the amount of CO2, the effect will be even larger."" Hansen drew a comparison, ""If we spend more money than what we're taking in , we're leaving a debt for our children and grandchildren to deal with .""According to Hansen, the responsibility lies in effective policy making to fight against global warming .That includes a gradual reduction in carbon emissions .Hansen suggests that a rising price be placed on carbon emissions, which should be collected from the fossil fuel companies at the first sale . Without effective measures taken by the government, Hansen said the public could expect more of the recent extreme weather patterns,, including more severe droughts and floods in the decades ahead .

Now, Gao has to go to prison   for six months and pay a 4,000 yuan fine. Gao is the first star to be punished under China's new drunk driving law. From May 1 on, drunk drivers will pay a fine, and be banned from driving for five years or even forever. Drunk driving has become a serious social problem in China.According to the Ministry of Public Security  , police caught more than half a million drunk drivers last year, a 68 % increase from 2009. The new law sees drunk driving as a crime. In the West, drunk driving is also a crime. In the US, for example, if the police catch a drunk driver, the driver will pay a fine, lose his or her license   and even go to prison. If the driver wants to drive again, he or she must do public service, and take part in educational programs. You may think: drunk driving is a crime? Isn't this law too unkind?

836,"The type of things we remember are different. Although we tend to remember good things in our lives, bad things have a way of   on us. One such thing I remember happened when I was 10 years old. I decided to ride my bicycle over a near-by stream. I carefully planned the adventure, and asked my friends to go there and have a watch. This was going to be my moment! I started riding down the hill, picking up speed and then pulled up on the   at the precise moment and landed face-first into the muddy stream! That painful moment is one that I will never forget. As long as I live, I will remember the pain and embarrassment at that moment. When we do something stupid or thoughtless, it has a way of sticking with us. Fortunately, good momories have a way of over-riding the bad ones. I have memories that I gladly remember, like what happened today. I had my first conversation with my son today. It was not anything . It was a simple connection between father and son. It was one of those bonding moments that you can't plan or force. They just happen on their own. I was walking into the living room where my son sat in bed watching television attentively. Then he looked up at me and pointed to the television and   something. I asked him if he was watching   and he nodded his head and said,""Yes"". It was at that moment that his eyes lit up and it was as if we both realized we had communicated. And how happy I was! Sure, at eighteen months, he probably did not realize what communication was like, but his joy at that moment was evident. It was a moment I will remember all my life. Good or bad, memories can last a lifetime. As for an unpleasant memory, though we can't forget it we can get lessons from it and it is like a mirror that will warn us against making such mistakes again. As for a good memory, we should try our best to enjoy it during our lifetime. Such moments are the treasures that we store up forever.

837,"Right is right. Right? Of course. But is left wrong? Well, the Romans used to think so. They thought left-handed people were mistakes of nature. Latin, the language of the Romans, had many words that expressed this view. Some words we use today still have this meaning. The Latin word ""dexter"" means ""right"". The English word ""dexterous"" comes from this word. It means ""handy"" (clever with hands). So, right is handy. But the Latin word for left is ""sinister"". The English word ""sinister"" comes from this word. Sinister means ""evil"" (very bad). Is it fair to call right-handed people handy and left-handed people evil? Well, fair or not, many languages have words that express such beliefs. In old English, the word for left means ""weak"". That isn't much of an improvement over ""evil"". Not very long ago, children were often forced to write with their right hands. Doctors have since found that this can be very harmful. You should use the hand you were born to use. People who use their left hands are just starting to get better treatment. But why they get all these bad names in the first place? One reason may be that there are not as many left-handed people as there are right-handed people. There is one left-handed person for every five right-handed ones. People who are different are often thought to be wrong. But attitudes do seem to be changing. Fair-minded right-handed people are finally starting to give left-handed people a hand.

839,"I never saw my father home from work late or ill, nor did I ever see my father take a ""night out with the boys"". He had no bobbies but just took care of his family. For 22 years, since I left home for college, my father called me every Sunday at 9:00 am. He was always interested in my life-how my family was doing. The calls even came when he and my mother were in Australia, England or Florida. Nine years ago when I bought me first house, my father, 67 years old, spent eight hours a day for three days, painting my house. He would not allow me to pay someone to have it done. All he asked, was a glass of iced tea, and that I hold a paintbrush for him and talk to him. But I was too busy, for I had a law practice to run, and I could not take the time to hold the paintbrush, or talk to my father. Five years ago, my 71-year-old father spent five hours putting together a swing set for my daughter. Again, all he asked was that I get him a glass of iced tea, and talk to him, But again, I had laundry to do, and the house to clean. The morning on Sunday, January 16, 1995, my father telephoned me as usual, this time he had seemed to have forgotten some things we had discussed the week before. I had to get to church, and I cut the conversation short. The call came at 4:40 am. That day my father was sent to hospital in Florida. I got on a plane immediately, and I vowed that when I arrived, I would make up for the lost time, and have a nice long talk with him ad really _ . I arrived in Florida at 1:00 am, but my father had passed away at 9:12 pm. This time it was he who did not have time to talk, or time to wait for me.

840,"Until I was twelve years old, I thought everyone in the world knew about the grinnies, if I thought about the term at all -- which is unlikely. After all, everyone in my family used the word quite naturally, and we understood each other. So far as I knew, it was a word like any other word  -- like bath, orchocolate, orhomework. But it was my homework which led to my discovery thatgrinnieswas a word not known outside my family. My last report card had said that I was a ""C"" student in English, and my parents, both teachers, decided that no child of theirs would be just an average student of anything. So nightly I spelled words aloud and answered questions about the fine points of grammar. I wrote and rewrote and rewrote every composition until I convinced my mother that I could make no more improvements. And the hard work paid off. One day the teacher returned compositions, and there it was -- a big fat, bright red ""A"" on the top of my paper. Naturally, I was delighted, but I didn't know I was attracting attention until the teacher spoke sharply, ""Helen, what are you doing?"" Called suddenly out of my happy thoughts, I said ""Oh, I've got the grinnies!"" The teacher and my classmates burst into laughter, and then I understood that grinnies were used inside my family. Other people were not so lucky. And it is really lucky to have the grinnies, an uncontrollable, natural state of great pleasure. Grinnies are shown on the outside by sparkling eyes and a wide, wide smile -- not just any smile, but one that shows the teeth and stretches the mouth to its limits. A person experiencing the grinnies appears to be all mouth. On the inside grinnies are characterized by a feeling of joyful anxiety. Grinnies usually last just a few seconds, but they can come and go. Sometimes, when life seems just perfect, I have occasional attacks of the grinnies for a whole day. The term originated in my mother's family. Her younger sister, Rose, who had deep dimples  , often expressed her pleasure with such a grin that the dimples appeared to become permanent. When Rose was about four, she started explaining her funny look by saying, ""I have the grinnies"". The term caught on, and it has been an important word in our family now for two generations. The occasion doesn't matter. Anything can bring on the grinnies -- just so long as one feels great delight. When my brother finally rode his bicycle -- without training wheels -- from our house to the corner and back, he came home with the grinnies. When I was little, my mother's announcement that we would have homemade ice cream for dessert always gave me the grinnies. My father had the grinnies when I was chosen to make a speech at the end-of-school-year ceremony. Grinnies can be brought on by a good meal, a sense of pride, a new friend, a telephone call from someone special, an achievement. Or sometimes one gets the grinnies for no reason at all: just a sudden sense of happiness can bring on a case. Whatever brings them on, an attack of the grinnies is among life's greatest pleasures. In fact, now that I look back on the experience, I feel sorry for my seventh-grade teacher. I think it's a pity that she didn't know the word grinnies. It's such a useful term for saying, ""I'm really, really pleased!"" After the writer was twelve years old, she   _  .","thought everyone knew the meaning of ""grinnies""","equaled ""grinnies"" to bath or chocolate in meaning","got to know ""grinnies"" was used only inside her family","discovered the word ""grinnies"" through her mother",C

Although puzzled by this answer, the farmer still hired  him. The little man worked well around the farm, busy all day, and the farmer felt pleased with the man's work. Then one night the wind blew strongly. Jumping out of the bed, the farmer carried a lantern and rushed next door to the hired man's sleeping quarters.

The farmer had no time to lose his temper. Instead, he hurried outside to prepare for the storm. To his surprise, he found everything had been prepared. The cows were in the barn, the chickens were in the coops, and the doors were barred. The shutters were tightly secured. Everything was tied down. Nothing could blow away. The farmer then understood what his hired man meant. When you're prepared, spiritually, mentally and physically , you have nothing to worry about. Can you sleep when the wind blows through your life?

At twenty past seven, I have breakfast with my parents. Usually I have eggs and milk. Sometimes I have bread and fruit juice. but I don't eat meat. I go to school at twenty to eight. My favourite subject is English and I like talking with my friends in English. Hi , I'm Zhao Li and I'm 13 years old. I'm from Xi'an and I'm a student in Grade 7. There are four people in my family and my sister and I share the same room. Every morning my sister and I get up at half past six, and then we read our Chinese or English books after we walk near my home for twenty minutes. At half past seven, we go to school.

849,"Abby Subark is a mother of two from Boston. ""For my kids, I'm nervous. I don't know if they'll be able to achieve their American dream."" She may be right. More than hard work or education, the best way to get rich in America is to be born rich. It is the case that somebody who is in the upper third of income, poor scores, in the bottom on tests when they are in eighth grade, is more likely to go to college and finish college than a poor kid with the top scores. That's what the working persons'  children are up against. The Economic Policy Institute finds it would take a poor couple with 2 children 9 or 10 generations to achieve middle class status. That's about 200 years. The hallmark   of American opportunity has always been the ability to do better than your parents. But compared with similar developed countries, the United States ranks fifth out of six for so-called intergenerational mobility  . If you look at the mechanisms   for upward mobility that were so readily available 50 years ago, they are becoming out of reach, like plentiful factory jobs with good wages and affordable education and health care. White families are twice as likely as blacks to be upwardly mobile. For most people in America today, _  If you started in the middle-income class, about 40 to 45 percent of what you are making right now is due to the fact that your parents were in the middle-income class. The rest is up to you. But for the millions of people who find themselves below the poverty line and the millions more who are the working poor, their starting point for the American dream leaves them painfully far away from the middle class. Why is Abby Subark nervous?",Her kids don't want to compare with other rich kids in achievements.,Her kids don't want to achieve success at all.,Her kids can achieve success through hard work and education.,Her kids can't reach their goal without a rich family.,D
850,"Since I became a full--time freelancer , I've found one of the hardest things to do is to get up early. Without the danger of being fired, there just hasn't been a lot of motivation  to get out of bed. I've quickly learned that getting up is the key to success and better yet: waking up early is really just a habit. The most important thing to keep in mind is that you must have strong reasons to get out of bed. Motivation is the only thing keeping us from lying in bed all day. Writing down all the big and important things you'll do the next day can give you an extra push in your goal to wake up early and quickly. Don't read in bed. Spending as little time as possible in bed will actually help your body realize that the bed is for sleeping, and not for lying awake for hours. The goal of reading in bed is just to help you fall asleep within 10 minutes. Stress is one of the main causes of poor sleep. Relax yourself before getting into bed. Try controlled breathing exercises or yoga to lower your stress level. These are just a few ways you can use to wake up earlier. Finding the best way is the most important, and it requires a little work. The key thing is that waking up should be a pleasant experience. If you can make waking up something you are looking forward to, you're already halfway on your journey toward becoming an early riser. What is the point of getting up early?",Motivation.,Experience.,Success.,Ability.,A

853,"Ask someone what they have done to help the environment recently and they will almost mention recycling, which is the process   of treating used things, such as paper or steel so that they can be used again. Recycling in the home is very important of course. However, being forced to recycle often means we already have more things than we need. We are now dealing with the results of that _ in the possible greenest way, but it would be far better if we did not bring so many things home in the first place. Here is an example. In the UK, the total of packaging increased by 12% between 1999 and 2005. It now makes up a third of a household's waste. In many supermarkets, foods are packaged twice with plastic and cardboard. Too much packaging causes serious environmental problems. The UK is running out of different kinds of ways for dealing with this unnecessary waste. If such packaging is burnt, it gives off greenhouse gases which go on to cause the greenhouse effect  . Recycling helps, but the process itself uses energy. The best way of avoiding this problem is to stop producing such unnecessary things in the first place. Food waste is another serious problem, too. Too many supermarkets encourage customers   to buy more than they need. They seldom encourage customers to reuse their plastic bags, for example. However, a few of them are coming round to the idea that this cannot continue. But this is not just about supermarkets. It is about all of us. We have learned to connect packaging with quality  . We have learned to think that something unpackaged is of poor quality. Is it true for all the products? In fact, more and more companies realized the importance of protecting the environment. They try to package what really should be packaged, including products in good quality. As more of us recycle, we are beginning to realize how many unnecessary things are being collected. We need to face the waste of our daily life. Although many people have taken action to recycle, we have a high mountain to climb. What does the passage mainly talk about?",Supermarkets should recycle first.,Packaging causes serious problems.,Needless things are mostly recycled.,Recycling should be done in the first place.,D
854,"Long ago, poems were recited out loud instead of being written down. When the Greeks first started the Olympics, they held poetry contests as well as athletic competitions. Now, poetry competitions have been revived  .This year 120,000 high school students competed in the first Poetry Out Loud National Recitation Contest, performing poems from memory for $100,000 in prizes. The first competitions were held in classrooms. The winners went on to school-wide contests, and then they competed in city and state competitions. Finally, the 50 state champions, along with the District of Columbia champion came to Washington, D.C. last week for the last show down. After the 51 champions competed against one another, 12 went on to the finals. Then the field was narrowed to five. The final five had one last chance to ""perform"" a poem. The overall champ, Jackson Hille, a high school senior from Ohio, won a $20,000 scholarship. The National Endowment for the Arts and the Poetry Foundation started Poetry Out Loud because they realized that hearing a poem performed is a different experience from reading it on a page. It's not just a matter of saying the words in the right order. It's the tone of voice, the pauses, the gestures, and the attitude of the person performing that bring the words to life. ""Each time we hear somebody recite a poem, we find something fresh and interesting about it, "" says National Public Radio Broadcaster Scott Simon, master of ceremonies for the finals. Hearing it in a new voice offers something new to the listener. Not only do the people hearing poems have a new experience, memorizing and presenting poems helps the participants   understand those poems in a new way. Another benefit of a competition such as Poetry Out Loud is that the participants learn public -speaking skills that can help them for life. What's the main idea of the passage?",Reciting poems improves your memory.,Remembering a lot of poems is fun.,Poets have a great time.,Poetry competitions freshen us up.,D
855,"This happened several years ago.But it has stuck with me so I wanted to share it. Every day on my way to work I would buy a newspaper from an elderly gentleman on the corner of the street.He would always smile and say,""Good morning.""His smile always made my day.

857,"A man enters a store to buy milk. He walks out of the store with milk. That is all-milk. At the same time, a woman enters the same grocery store also to buy milk. She buys it. But she also buys chicken and lemons to make dinner that night. Then she remembers to buy food for her son to eat at school. She also gets a bottle of wine for drinks with friends and a birthday card for her husband's niece. Then she gets coffee for breakfast, ice cream for dessert and remembers stamps to mail the bills. And don't forget soap for the bathroom. And that is the difference between the female and male brains simply explained in a grocery store. Generally speaking, men do one thing at a time. Women do many. Now scientific research supports this theory about male and female brains. A recent study has confirmed what we have known all along--men and women think differently. Scientists at the University of Pennsylvania studied brain images of 949 people aged from eight to 22 years old. They found that male brains have more connections on one side of the brain, or hemisphere. In the female brains, they found more activity and connections between the right and left sides of the brain. The left side of the brain is known as the side of ""reason."" The right hemisphere is known as the ""creative"" side. Regina Verma is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. She co-wrote the report. She says when women are asked to do something difficult they might use different parts of the brain. Men, she adds, generally use just one side of the brain. As a result, men generally deal directly with a problem. There is a strong connection between the ""understanding"" and the ""action"" parts of their brains. Women, however, might include other parts of the brain when solving a problem. Women take a less direct path to find a solution. What causes the difference between men's and women's behavior?",Watching things from different sides.,Having different attitudes towards life.,Using different parts of the brain to think.,Reacting at different speed to problems.,C

860,"Popular music in America is what every student likes. Students carry small radios with earphones and listen to music before class, after class, and at lunch. Students with cars buy large speakers and play the music loudly as they drive on the street. Adult drivers listen to music on the car radio as they drive to work. They also listen to the news about sports, the weather, and the life of American people. Most of the radio programmers are music. Pop or popular music singers make much money. They make a CD or a tape which radio stations use in many places. Once the popular singer is heard all over the country, young people buy his or her tape. Some of the money from these tapes goes to the singer. Wherever the singer goes, all the young people want to meet him or her. Now the singer has become a national  star.

862,"At the recent O&P Extremity Games, I had the opportunity to observe a new generation of athletes with disabilities who were skateboarding and rock climbing. These young people really showed the promise of how rewarding physical activities are! We disabled can - and should be -- as active as anyone else. When we get and stay active, we will feel better, be able to do more, have healthier bodies, and look better. It is a fact that exercise actually produces energy and builds on itself. The more we exercise, the fitter our bodies are, and thus the more energy we have to enjoy recreation and the pleasure of life.    Not everyone is cut out to be a competitive athlete, but there are things that we can do to strengthen our physical well-being. Experts recommend that spending as little as 30 minutes each day on physical activities provides benefits including lower risk of heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes   and other serious diseases. Taking steps to become physically fit does not have to mean acquiring expensive training equipment or a gym membership. Exercise can include simple walking and running, gardening, cleaning the house, swimming, tennis, bicycling (stationary or on the road) and so on. The key is to do it on a regular basis.    Healthy lifestyles also require good nutritional habits. When choosing foods, nutritionists advise whole grains, flesh fruits and vegetables, fish, and lean   cuts of poultry and meat. The benefits of drinking eight full glasses of water a day are also  _ . Water provides the means for nutrients to travel to all our organs, improves skin tone   , regulates body temperature and contributes to muscle strength and control, which is confirmed by scientists.    Fitness results in completing the tasks of daily living, working a full day, and still having energy to participate in recreational activities. By being fit, you'll find that you enjoy recreational activities even more because you won't be tired or suffer from gore muscles.    It is time, folks, to get moving. So let's all get out there and do some exercise! What do we learn from the passage?",Water can provide nutrients for us to improve skin tone.,Extreme sports have little to do with normal people.,One can enjoy recreation and the pleasure of life by doing extreme games.,We can have more energy to do things in our everyday life if we strengthen our physical well-being.,D

864,"""BANG!"" the door caused a reverberation  . It was just standing there, with Father standing on one side, and I on the other side. We were both in great anger. ""Never set foot in this house again!"" stormed Father. With tears welling up in my eyes, I rushed out of the flat and ran along the street. The street lights were shining, causing rather sad-feeling. I wandered aimlessly. A young father who held a child in his arms walked past me. I felt as if I saw my childhood from another space: happy and carefree. But now... I don't know whether it is because I have grown up or because Dad is getting old. We differ in our ways of thinking. He always puts his opinions and codes of behaviour on me. Whenever I do something wrong, he never admits it. We are just like two people coming from two different worlds. It feels like there is an iron door between us that can never be opened. I wandered in the streets, without a destination in mind. My heart was frozen on this hot summer night. As I walked on there were fewer and fewer people on the streets, until I had only the street lights to keep me company. When I finally reached the high-rise apartment block in which I lived, I saw that the light was still on. I thought to myself: ""Is Father waiting for me, or is he still angry with me?"" In fact, it was nothing. Perhaps, Dad was throwing away some of his old stamps. Perhaps he thought they were useless. I never had the courage to tell him that I liked collecting stamps. I can't stand his outrageous   words: ""I can't throw you away, let alone these old papers?"" All the lights were off except Father's. Dad was always like this. Maybe he didn't know how to express himself. After shouting at me, he never showed any mercy or any moments of regret. After an argument he has the habit of creeping up   in my sleep and then tucking me underneath the covers. This was how he always was. He has been a leader for so long that telling everyone else what to do has become his second nature. The light was still on. ""Am I wrong?"" I whispered, maybe... With the key in hand, I was as nervous as I had ever been. At last, I decided to open the door. As soon as I opened the door tears ran down my cheeks. I suddenly realized that the iron door that I had imagined between us did not exist   at all. Love---is second to none. Why do you think the father often shouts at his son?",Perhaps the father is getting older and older.,Perhaps the son has already grown up.,Perhaps they never agree with each other.,Perhaps the father has got used to doing that.,D
865,"As far back as 700 B. C, man has talked about children being cared for by wolves. Romulus and Remus, the legendary twin founders of Rome, were said to have been cared for by wolves. It is believed that when a she-wolf loses her litter, she tries to get human child to take its place. This seemingly foolish and unreasonable idea did not become believable until the late nineteenth century when a French doctor actually found a ten-year-old boy having nothing on wandering in the woods. He didn't walk upright, could not speak understandably, nor could he relate to people. He only growled and stared at them. Finally the doctor won the boy's confidence and began to work with him.

869,"Every year in late spring at Wild Friends, the wildlife health center, workers receive baby animals, including songbirds and rabbits. This is the busiest time when workers care for and raise all the little ones before sending them back into the wild. There are many reasons for these little animals' coming to the center. First of all, street cats or dogs catch, injure or take away little birds from their nests. Sometimes people catch baby animals and keep them at home, giving them food that they are not used to. It would make them sick. Most people don't realize that it's against law to get live animals out of their nests. As for songbirds, people often find them on the ground in their yards, thinking they have no other choice but to leave them on the ground to die. This is because many people wrongly believe that once a bird is touched by a person, its mother will not accept this child bird. But that's not true. If a little bird falls out of the nest, you should check whether it is injured. If not, you should put the bird back in the nest. If the bird is injured, call your local wildlife center quickly. As for the progress of protecting wild animals, people at Wild Friends devote all their energy to this work. Over the last weeks, they have been able to send many of the birds and rabbits that came here earlier this spring back to nature.

He was carrying one small backpack, which was very full, but he didn't have any other luggage. Brian needed to meet a man named Tony before he checked in for his flight. He found Tony near the Air France counter. Tony gave him a round-trip ticket and a small package. ""Give this package to Jean-Paul at the airport in Paris. He will have a sign with your name on it. I think you can find him easily,"" Tony said, ""You don't have any luggage, right?"" ""Only this backpack,"" Brian answered. ""You said I could bring one carry-on bag."" ""That's right. One carry-on bag is fine. Have a good trip."" ""Thanks."" Is Brian a criminal ? Not at all. He is an air-courier. And he paid only $110 for the round-trip ticket to Paris. Air couriers get cheap airline tickets because they take important packages and papers to foreign countries. Businesses sometimes need to get packages and papers to people in foreign countries by the next day. Often, the only way they can do this is to use an air-courier company. It is not cheap for a business to send a package with an air courier, but it is quick. Every year about 80,000 people worldwide travel as air couriers. The number of tickets for courier travel is growing by about 10 percent a year. However, air-courier travel isn't for everyone. But if you have very little money, can be flexible  about your travel plans, and don't mind wearing the same clothes for a week, it can be a great way to take a vacation! Businesses choose the air-courier service because  _  .",it costs less,it is flexible,it saves time,it grows fast,C

873,"Dear Bridge of Hope supporters, July 2010 was a productive month for the teachers at BOH. Marilyn traveled to Liberia and helped Kathleen Ngenda with her teacher training program on Basic Adult Literacy. During the eight-day training, she helped the teachers learn to pronounce, spell and write correctly. They are currently working on personal sets of cards and lists so that they can teach this concept to students in the fall. Kathleen plans on two trips back to the school to monitor teachers in their teaching. Marilyn found a very dedicated  and enthusiastic group of elementary teachers who are focused on bettering themselves as educators. BOHUSA will offer financial support for their further educational studies this fall. Our goal is to have all staff be certified by the end of 2013. The Liberian government recommends a C-certificate for teachers of elementary students, which can be obtained in one year of education classes (taken on Saturdays). There is a great need to add seventh and eighth grade classrooms and a library. There is actually no room, however, and so we need to add a second floor. Currently the ground floor houses the church and the school uses this space for daily services. The first floor would give space for three more classrooms, in addition to a large reading room and computer labs. About $40,000 to 50,000 is required to meet the educational needs.

Challenge yourself to think about the environment as you live your life. If you shut off lights when you leave the room, turn off your TV when you're not watching it, you'll save energy. If you take shorter showers, you'll save water. 2. Shop Green. Shopping is fun, but buying things you don't need is wasteful and bad for the earth. Before you buy something, ask yourself how much you'll really use it. Keep yourself away from buying products with unnecessary packaging  , and whenever possible, buy things that were locally made instead of those shipped from far away. 3. Dress Green. Wear green trousers and T-shirts if you want. But what really matters isn't the colour, it's how the clothes were made. If you want to help the environment, the best place to find clothes is at _ , but you might not want to buy everything used. No matter where you shop, keep an eye out for products made from environmentally friendly materials like organic  cotton, which is grown without the use of pesticides ( ). 4. Study Green. What's better than learning about the environment? Save it while you learn, It can be as simple as using both sides of a piece of paper before you recycle it, or reusing an old textbook :instead of buying a new one.

876,"Traditional Japanese food is surely one of the healthiest and most delicious in the world, and _ , foods like tofu, sushi and even green tea are now familiar and can be found easily out of Japan. As a national cuisine , thanks to many social as well as political changes, Japanese food has greatly developed over the past few centuries. In ancient times, when much of the traditional cuisine was influenced by Korean and Chinese cultures, Japanese cuisine slowly changed with the start of the medieval period, which brought along with it new tastes. With the coming of the modern age, a great many changes took place and the Japanese cuisine was influenced greatly by Western culture. However, the traditional Japanese food of today is still very like what existed toward the end of the 19th century. This would mean that a large part of the Japanese cuisine includes those foods whose cooking methods and ingredients have been introduced from other cultures, but which have since then been experimented with and developed by the Japanese themselves. The thing about Japanese food is that you either will love it or will completely look down upon it. With traditional Japanese food, there is no such thing as an in-between. However, chances are that if you hate Japanese food, then you probably haven't even tasted real Japanese food or you simply haven't given yourself the chance to like it. Unlike other cuisines, Japanese food is not something that you will appreciate after having only a bite. Like wines and cigars, Japanese food needs time to be liked. What does the writer mean by saying ""fortunately for most of us""?",That most people know how to prepare tofu and sushi themselves.,That most traditional Japanese food can be enjoyed everywhere.,That we can enjoy some traditional Japanese food out of Japan.,"That Japanese food like tofu, sushi and even green tea is not strange to us.",C

All of my peers and teachers world have normal hearing. I was the only deaf child at Blue Creel Elementary School. From almost the first day there, the other kids made fun of me mainly because of my hearing aid and the way I talked. And I also had difficulty with most of my school work. When the other kids made fun of me, I was sure that I was a bad person. I saw myself as a boy who wasn't smart enough to keep up with the class. Mrs. Jordan, my 5th grade teacher, changed all of that with a simple three-word phrase. One morning, she asked the class a question. I read her lips from my front-row seat and immediately raised my hand because I was sure I had the right answer. But when she called on me, I was afraid. Here was an opportunity to impress the powerful teacher and show her I was worthy of her love. Maybe even impress my classmates a little. I didn't want to blow it. despite my fears, I took a deep breath and answered Mrs. Jordan's question. I will never forget what happened next. Mrs. Jordan enthusiastically slammed  her right foot on the floor and turned her tight hand around in full circle until it pointed directly at me. With sparking eyes and a wide smile she cried, ""THAT'S RIGHT STEPHEN!"" For the first time in my young life, I was a star. I sat a little taller in my chair. From that day forward, my grades and speech improved greatly. My popularity among my peers increased. It was all because Mrs. Jordan believed in me and wasn't afraid to express it.

878,"We would probably all be amazed if we watched a videotape of ourselves performing basically unconscious acts as we go about the business of the day. These unconscious acts consist of all the little personal habits that we don't even think about, but definitely should. These are some of the things that present an image of who we are to others, and if we are careless in performing them, this image may well be other than we would like it to be. Parents who insist that their children practice good manners and habits at home are doing them a great service, for these habits then become lifelong and the natural way they do things. It proves true that their unconscious actions will reflect a well-mannered person. People who, for example, eat with both arms on the table at home will likely do so when out. Those who are lazy and slow in private will certainly be so in public. Children who are permitted to be disrespectful to their parents will follow suit with other adults, and will, most likely, become adults who are disrespectful of others. This is an area where the saying ""practice makes perfect"" may be applied. There is an article about the actress, Audrey Hepburn, known for her beautiful carriage and posture. According to her biographer, her grandmother tied her neck to the back of her chair, at table, so that she would not drop down suddenly over her food, but rather would learn to put only small amounts of food on her spoon or fork and bring them to her mouth. This is a rather extreme ""at home"" method for the development of erect   posture, but it does illustrate the effectiveness of practicing good habits so that, when in public, they are instinctive. Which of the following are NOT true?","If we are not careful about our unconscious acts, the images of ourselves presented to others will be quite undesirable.",The good habits formed in one's childhood will benefit him throughout his life.,"If parents do not care about the disrespectful attitude adopted by their children towards themselves, their children might be disrespectful to others.",It is unlikely that a well-mannered person will not embarrass himself in public.,D

880,"A mystery surrounds my grandmother's collection of salt cellars  . No one in the family seems to know when she started collecting them, or exactly how many she had. My grandmother died just over two years ago. At 91, she had spent 30 years without her right leg, which was removed due to cancer the year I was born. She was a poet, an artist, a food lover and a salt cellar collector. The funny thing about the salts, as she called them -- I never once heard her say salt cellar -- was that although everybody knew they were her hobby and everyone was always searching for them at yard sales or in stores, nobody seemed to know what they meant to her and they just wanted to make her happy. Grandma kept her salts in a dark wooden corner display case in the living room. Since her death the case has remained exactly as she left it. Grandpa tries his best to preserve his memories of her just as they are.  Now I am collecting, too. Collecting memories about my grandmother's hobby, a way she spent her time. And as I hold one of them in my hand, I picture her holding it in her hand on the day she got it. She is smiling. My mother and her two sisters all have small collections, but my mother admits that she was more interested in finding salts to send to Grandma.  Grandma once wrote a poem titled ""When April Comes"". The poem contains the line, ""When April comes and I am not around, remember me when daffodils are found."" Now, Grandpa is working on a poem with the line, ""April came and you were not around"". But she was, somehow. She was there in the memories left behind by her possessions.

881,"Imagine that you are the first person ever to see Hawaii. What would be the first thing you would set foot on? The beach, naturally. There are hundreds of miles of beaches on the twenty islands of Hawaii. These islands cover 1,600 miles and are about 2,300 miles west of California. Most of them are covered with fine white sand. They are thought to be among the finest beaches in the world. Another wonderful thing about the beaches of Hawaii is the water temperature. The year-round average  temperature of the water at the famous Waikiki Beach is 230C! The same is true of air temperature. In fact, there are no real seasons in Hawaii. There is a difference of only two or three degrees between the hottest day of summer and the coldest day of winter. That's why the Hawaiians don't have a word for weather in their language. Perhaps the nicest thing about Hawaiian beaches are the waves. The earliest settlers   in Hawaii, the Polynesians, quickly learned how much fun it was to ride the waves. They developed a sport which is now very popular on the islands called body surfing. You go out into the ocean, wait for a big wave to come towards you, jump on it, and ride it all the way to the beach. Now imagine once again that you are the first person ever to set foot in Hawaii. What do you think would be the second beautiful thing you would notice? Would it be those strange triangles   rising out of the water hundreds and hundreds of meters high? What are those beautiful things? They are volcanoes  , of course. These volcanoes are not just a part of the islands. They made the islands at first. Because of them the islands are still growing. The most famous volcano on Hawaii is Mauna Loa. It is the world's most active volcano. It has been erupting   for thousands of years. Even when it isn't erupting, smoke comes out of the earth from a thousand little holes. In 1950 Mauna Loa erupted for twenty-three days. That erupting produced the greatest amount of lava   in modern history. In 1960 it erupted again. That time it added a kilometer of beach to the island. Because Mauna Loa has erupted so often, it has become the biggest (but not the tallest) mountain in the world. These volcanoes could be dangerous to the population of Hawaii. In fact, Hilo, the second largest city in Hawaii, is built just under Mauna Loa. The volcano could erupt at any time. Most people believe that it will erupt sometime in the next twenty-five years. But the people of Hilo do not seem worried. They live with the danger as part of their lives. It can be inferred that   _   according to the passage.",volcanoes are more active because the area of the island is enlarging,the visitors to Hawaii can probably see more than one active volcano,Mauna Loa is the tallest mountain in the world because it has erupted so often,people in Hilo are sure that more visitors will come because of volcanoes,B
882,"Every year thousands of people get hurt or die when they are crossing the road. Most of these people are old people and children. Old people often get hurt or die because they can't see or hear very well. Children usually meet with accidents because of their carelessness. They forgot to look and listen before they cross the road. How can we lessen  traffic accidents? All of us must obey the traffic rules. For the drivers, they shouldn't drive too fast. If they drive too fast, it will be very difficult to stop the cars in a very short time. For the pedestrians , it's very important to be careful when they are walking on the road. Therefore, when we walk across the road, we must try to walk along the pavements. We must stop and look both ways before crossing the road. Look left first, next look right, then look left again. Only when we are sure that the road is clear, we can cross it. The right way to cross the road is to walk quickly. It's not safe to run. If people run across the road, they may fall down.

883,"An artist in Oakland, California is using his skills to help the homeless. Greg Kloehn builds very small shelters that make life on the streets more comfortable. The structures offer the homeless some safety and protection from bad weather. Each little house also has wheels on the bottom so it can go wherever its owner goes. Greg Kloehn has given away at least 20 tiny houses to the homeless on the street. On a recent day, Mr. Kloehn stops to visit his homeless friends. One of them is Oscar Young. The two men hug when they see each other. Inside his little shelter Mr. Young gets relief from cold nights on the streets. Mr. Kloehn also visits Sweet-Pea, another friend who also lives in one of the little homes the artist built. She says it keeps her safe and protects her belongings. In the mornings, Mr. Kloehn searches the streets for building materials. He gathers what he can and takes it to his studio. There, he puts the houses together. Empty coffee bags become roof material. A washing machine door and refrigerator part become windows. Nails, screws and the sticky glue hold all the pieces together. The artist also attaches a small electrical device  to the house. The device is powered by the sun. Some of the people living on the streets once had normal houses of their own. But some of the people say they have learned to live with less and they are thankful to that man. Mr. Kloehn says his work is not a social project.

884,"Gauri Nanda sees a wearable computer as a handbag -- one that's built out of four-inch squares and triangles of fiber, with tiny computer chips embedded   in it. It looks, feels and weighs like your typical leather purse. That's where similarities end: This bag can wirelessly keep track of your belongings and remind you, just as you're about to leave the house, to take your wallet. It can review the weather report and suggest that you grab an umbrella. This purse can even upload your favorite songs onto your scarf. Sure, a computing purse and scarf set may seem like the stuff of science fiction. But these devices, part of next generation of wearable computers, could become commonplace within a few years. DuPont created new super strong fibers that can conduct electricity and can be woven into ordinary-looking clothes. And the chipmaker developed chip packaging allowing wearable computers to be washed, even in the heavy-duty cycle. As a result, these new wearable devices are different from the heavy and downright silly versions of the recent past, which often required users to be wrapped in wires and type on their stomachs. Unlike their predecessors, these new wearable computers also make economic sense. When her bag becomes commercially available in two to three years, Nanda expects it will cost around $150, which is the price of an average leather purse. Here's how the bag works: You place a special radio-signal-transmitting chip on to your wallet. A similar radio in your purse picks up the signal and notifies you that you've forgotten to take your wallet. In turn, sensors on your purse's handles will notify the computer that you've picked up the purse and are ready to go.  _ Indeed, more people will want to cross that bridge in the coming years -- making for a booming market for wearable computers that don't like something out of science fiction. According to the passage, these new wearable computers   _  .",require users to operate on the stomach,pick up the signals through wires and chip,are being applied in some different areas now,are smarter but more expensive than the old ones,C

887,"Earlier this year,my oldest daughter got braces   on her teeth,and let's just say she did not go quietly into that dentist's chair. Fear and hate pretty much describe the days leading up to her first appointment. So when she finally walked out with shiny teeth,a sore mouth and a broken spirit, I told her I was proud of her and took her to Ben & Jerry's for an ice cream reward. Two weeks later, we returned to the scene of  the  crime.The  dentist  spent  about 45 seconds checking her teeth before sending her on her merry way. Before I could start the car, she was placing her ice cream order. She was shocked when I told her that she wasn't going to get a reward every time we got her teeth checked. Apparently,she's not alone. According to some parenting experts, kids are easily addicted to a benefitproducing system of parental rewards and bribes --not all ice creams, candies and cool toys.Some parents are offering their children novel prizes just to let them sit down and behave in a restaurant--or sleep in their own beds--or score a goal in the next soccer game. While the experts agree that occasional awards are okay,the danger lies in the system's overuse.Kids quickly gain a sense of entitlement ,where they come to expect a big reward for every good thing that they do, no matter how small.To keep things in check,experts say parents should reduce the number of rewards they offer, make sure rewards match the behavior and explain the real benefits of behaving.

So I said to myself, ""I am going to try to make that clerk like me. Obviously, to make him like me, I must say something nice, not about myself, but about him."" So I asked myself, ""What is there about him that I can honestly admire?"" That is sometimes a hard question to answer, especially with strangers. However, in this case, it happened to be easy. I instantly saw something I admired very much. So while he was weighing my envelope, I remarked with enthusiasm, ""I certainly wish I had your hair."" He looked up and his face was full of smiles.

No one knows how many Americans belong to reading groups called book clubs. Yet publishers  and bookshops report that more and more throughout the United States are joining the clubs. Most of the clubs work the same way. Members read the same book at the same time. Then they meet to talk about the book. Members may be friends or people who live near each other. Or, they may be people who work together. Book clubs may be for only women or only men. Or, they can be for husbands and wives together.

890,"The time children spend outdoors could be linked to a reduced risk of being short-sighted, research suggests.    An analysis of eight previous studies by University of Cambridge researchers found that for each additional hour spent outside per week, the risk of short-sightedness was reduced by 2%.They said exposure to natural light and time spent looking at distant objects could be key factors .    The studies involved more than 10,000 children and adolescents. Dr Justin Sherwin and his research team concluded that short-sighted children spent an average of 3.7 fewer hours per week outdoors than those who either had normal vision or were far-sighted.    But they said the reasons were not yet clear.They expected to find that children who spent more time outdoors also spent less time doing activities like reading, studying or playing computer games, but no such link was found in two of the eight studies which looked at this relationship.    However, Dr Sherwin said they would now need more precise data to try to understand which factors,  such as increased use of distance vision, reduced use of near vision, natural ultraviolet  light exposure  and physical activity,are most important.    ""Any increase in time spent outdoors must be weighed against exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the increased risk of skin cancer, cataracts and other cancers.""he said.""On the other hand, increasing outdoor physical activity could protect against diabetes and obesity, for example.""     Short-sightedness is a common eye condition that causes distant objects to appear blurred , while close objects can be seen clearly. It is much more common today in the UK and the United States than it was just 30 to 40 years ago.

One teenage girl, curling   in pain in her wheelchair, stood unaided to dance to a hip-hop song she had written. A 12-year-old boy with Hodgkin's disease who rarely spoke surprised his doctors with a song he calledI Can Make It. ""My time with the kids is heartbreaking because of the severity of their illnesses,"" says Anita Kruse. ""But they also make you happy, when the children are smiling, excited to share their CD with their families."" Simran is now an active sixth grader and cancer-free. From time to time, she and her mother listen to her song,Always Remembering, and they always remember the ""really sweet and nice and loving"" lady who gave them a shining moment in the dark hour. What does the case of a 12-year-old boy suggest?",Most children are naturally fond of music.,He was brave enough to put up performance.,The project has positive effect on young patients.,Singing is the best way to treat some illnesses.,C

894,"""How can I learn English well?"" This is a question many students ask. In my opinion, the most effective way is to learn lessons by heart. If you can recite the text and write it out, you've learned it fairly well. And if you can tell, in your own words, what the lesson says you're a very successful learner indeed. Your English will be quite perfect.This is a difficult task. However, if you try to learn by heart only part of each lesson, you'll find it not half so hard as you might have thought. Learning this way, you will make rapid progress. Of course, writing is also necessary. It helps you a lot on our way to success in English. Equally important is to feel the language. You should be able to laugh at jokes and be shocked at bad news. When using English, try to forget your mother tongue. Instead of helping you, your own language gets in your way. So, never try to see English through translation. In the writer's opinion, the most effective way in learning English is   _  .","to practise speaking, writing and feeling it",to forget your own native language,to translate everything into his own language,to memorize the English words and grammatical rules,A
895,"Imagine life without the Internet -- not being able to chat with your friends or look up information for your homework or research project. That is the reality for nearly two-thirds of our world's population, either because they cannot afford WiFi access or are located in remote, inaccessible areas. Now Google has decided to do something about that. Google's Project Loon will attempt to send balloons high up into our earth's atmosphere in 2015. Each balloon will be equipped with a mini computer and a WiFi radio that will send Internet signals over the places it is floating over. The network equipment on Google balloons will communicate with a special antenna   attached to each user's home. These antennae are in turn connected to a local Internet Service Provider. Each balloon will also communicate with each other to hand over signals as one floats out of an area, and another floats in. The balloons are 15 meters wide and made of a material that is three times thicker than the plastic bag at the supermarket. This helps them defend themselves against cold temperatures and changing air pressure. Google balloons will circle the earth at a height of 20 kilometers-- in a layer of our atmosphere known as the stratosphere  . This is higher than the altitude at which planes fly. Once the balloons reach the desired altitude after being released from the earth, they will ride on air currents.   What keeps these balloons from flying away? They will be controlled by people at the Project Loon command center. A pump operating on solar power will fill the balloon with gas to raise it or let gas out to lower it, based on instructions. This allows the balloon to float on different air currents which are moving either clockwise   or anti-clockwise. There is no doubt that this technology can bring education to many children, weather information to farmers, and communication to natural disaster areas. However, one big question remains -- will some countries be comfortable with balloons above their heads? There could be concerns about spying and other problems. According to the text, Google balloons_.",are as big as plastic bags at a supermarket,will float in a certain area for a long time,are equipped with a radio telephone,will be placed in the stratosphere,D

897,"You've probably grown accustomed to texting in the glow of a mobile phone screen. Well, there's some good and bad news coming for those of you who spend hours speedily tapping messages to one another.  The good news is that the hours you spend face-to-phone are paying off. You may have become fluent in a second language.  The bad news, however, is that this language is texting. Worse still, there isn't yet a texting section in your school exams, so you'll need to work harder to recover the grammar skills you might be killing with every LOL and BRB (Be right back).  A new study confirms what many parents suspect. The more kids send and receive texts, the poorer their grammar skills become.  With ""the culture of mobile communication--quick back and forth  , there are compromises on traditional, cultural writing"", said S. Shyam Sundar, professor of Pennsylvania State University, which conducted the study.  ""Techspeak"", as Sundar and his research partner Drew P. Cingel call it, has become so prevalent   among young users that it's changing their foundation of basic grammar.  ""Routine use of textual   adaptations by current and future generations of 13-to-17-year-olds may serve to create the impression that this is normal and accepted use of the language, ""they said in their published findings.  It seems teenagers are unable to ""code  switch-shift"" between standard grammar and the abbreviations   used in text messages, Sundar said. These abbreviations have become the real words for them now.  However, linguists   aren't particularly disturbed by the trend, Sundar added. ""The linguists will tell you the language is very dynamic. "" Still, students have exams to worry about. Here's a sample  of the questions, so you can test yourself to see how texting has affected your grammar:  *During the flood, we (dranked, drank, drunk, drunked) bottled water.  *Fortunately, Jim's name was (accepted, excepted) from the list of those who would have to clean bathrooms because he was supposed to go downtown to (accept, except) a reward for the German Club.  *The dress is so large that it is (lose, loose) on me when I wear it!

After suffering through many months of unemployment, my wife and I had to move this week from Colorado to Ohio, where she would work as a sales assistant. Not knowing a person there, we were pretty concerned about all the work, including how we'd get all the things unloaded without killing ourselves. We decided to pay a couple of college students to help with all the heavy lifting once we got there. But one neighbor after another stopped by and joined in. ""What? Have we moved to some other country? Maybe we've died and gone to heaven!"" I thought. Unloading actually became fun as we connected with so many wonderful new friends as we worked. The more people that helped, the easier the work became. A job we were afraid might take days for the two of us alone was done in just a few hours. Many total strangers would either walk by or drive by to ask us if we were moving in. Many were delighted that this fine old house that had sat empty for so long was coming to life again. We were invited to an outdoor meal yesterday by neighbors on the same street. All the while, my brain was on this new sense of hope that people could be outgoing and kind to strangers. Among all the conversations were lots of offers to be of help to one another in a variety of ways. It's wonderful to live in such a kind little town. I feel so grateful to be here, and wish the rest of the world could see how an entire society can be a model for what it's like to look out for one another.

899,"According to some predictions, human beings will die out in 2012. Nearly all people think it's impossible, but there are some more earthquakes in recent years. Animals can predict the weather or other natural events. It may sound strange, but farmers living in the countryside think so. For hundreds of years , they have observed animals. ""Animals ' behavior can be connected to future weather conditions or events."" They say. For example, if cows lie down, a rainstorm is coming. There are many traditional stories connecting animals and natural events. Many people think that these stories don't have scientific evidence(  ) at all. Scientists, however, are beginning to take another look at some of these ideas. A Japanese earthquake researcher named Kiyoshi Shimamura noticed an increase in dog bites a short time before earthquake hit. Then he did research on twelve public health centers in Kobe, Japan. These health centers treated people after the 1995 earthquake . He got some interesting information about the month before the big earthquake:  treatment for animals' bites had increased . In fact, aggressive behavior in dogs, such as biting and barking loudly , jumped 60 percent. There are also other changes in animals' behavior before the earthquake. For example, fish began swimming together in large groups , but only in the middle of the water and not near the edges. Birds flew away from their nests for many days, leaving their eggs unprotected . These animals' behavior suggests that animals may be able to predict natural events better than people.

900,"Science, as we think, was born when the Greek philosopher (  ) Thales ( about 640-546 B.C.) asked a difficult question: What makes up our universe? No one had a ready answer, so Thales went on studying the earth around him, the sky and the stars. He saw so much water on earth and so much water falling from the sky as rain that he decided water must be the basic substance (  ) of the universe. Other Greek thinkers became interested in this question. They suggested other answers. One said that because air lies around the earth, it must be air that makes up all things. Another said that fire, appearing in different forms, was the building block of the universe. The Greek philosophers were feeling their way towards the ideas on which chemistry is based. Centuries later, scientists proved that the universe is made up of certain basic substances. But the list is much more _ than the Greeks realized. We now know of 103 basic substances which we call "" elements (  )"".

The Carsons live in their own house, which has four bedrooms including the one in the basement  which I live in. Judy does all the work in the house and Andrew is responsible for the work in the garden. When they go out in they evening, they often ask me to look after their children.     Judy's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Morris, lived in another city. Judy was their only child and naturally they doted on Judy's children. They often sent the children presents.     Last April Mr. Morris died. Now that Mrs. Morris was quite alone, I expected that Judy would want her to come and live with them. One day, Margaret, Judy's daughter, told me grandma was coming to live with them and her daddy and mummy would want my room back. The news didn't surprise me and the next day I went to Judy and asked her about it. I said I couldn't think of living in their basement room any longer if it was needed for Mrs. Morris. Judy seemed surprised at first. Then she told me there was no deed for me to move, for they hadn't yet come to any decision about her mother coming to live with them. ""Naturally I'm worried about my mother. She has been in poor health."" She smiled sadly and added. ""To be honest, Andrew and my mother have never got on well. We'll wait a bit and see what happens. Perhaps Mohter will be all right living herself, or perhaps they will both change their minds.""     That was six months ago. During this time I've heard that Mrs. Morris has had two illnesses and that her health has got worse. A nursing home was mentioned once but Mrs. Morris refused to go there.

902,"Studies show that laughter is something that makes you feel calm or relaxed for both physical and psychological wounds though it may seem futile to laugh in the face of pain and fear. When Dan Rather interviewed comedian Bill Cosby just one week after his son, Ennis, was killed, Cosby said, ""I think it is time for me to tell people that we have to laugh. You can turn painful situations around through laughter. If you can find humor in anything, you can survive it."" Call it a flashlight for dark times: laughter just seems to adjust attitude better than anything else. Inspirational speaker Steve Rizzo recalls a TV interview with an injured firefighter a few days after 9.11.The man had fallen more than 30 stories in one of the towers and had broken a leg. Everyone was crying, and the reporter asked, ""How is it that you've come out of this alive?"" He looked at her and without missing a beat, said, ""Look, lady, I'm from New York and I'm a firefighter; that' all you need to know."" ""Everyone laughed and though the laughter was only a couple of seconds,"" says Rizzo. ""Sometimes that's all you need to catch your second breath. Laughter gives you that couple of seconds. You're sending a message to your brain, and the message is: If you can still laugh even a little among the pain, you are going to be OK."" Of course, there is a difference between laughing off a serious situation and laughing off the fear that results. The firefighter was doing the latter, states Rizzo, the author of Becoming a Humorous Being, and so should we. ""If there is anything we have learnt from 9.11, it's how precious life really is,"" she says. ""We have to send a message that our spirit won't die.

903,"In England, Christmas is the most important holiday in the year. Two important things, apart from its religious significance, help to set this holiday apart from all others: the custom of giving presents and the habit of spending it with the family. In the present highly commercialized age we are reminded of Christmas many weeks before the event. In the shops the special Christmas displays appear and outside them the special Christmas decorations. In the shopping centers of very large towns decorations are put up in the streets. In London thousands of people crowded into the centre of the town to see the decorations. The advertisements in all the newspapers remind us every day that there are ""Only X more shopping days to Christmas"". The Post Office vans are covered with brightly color1ed pictures advising us to ""Post Early for Christmas"", for hundred of millions of Christmas cards and millions of parcels are sent every year. Everywhere one turns, one is made aware that Christmas, which comes ""but once a year"", is coming once again.         Many people feel sorrow about what they consider the over-commercialization of a sacred holiday, but, underneath all the business activities, a great deal of Christmas spirit is to be found. The custom of giving presents to one's family and friends is a very pleasant one so long as one remembers that it is the spirit behind the present which matters most and not the present itself. And how good it is at Christmas to return to the family home and meet parents, grandparents and as many aunts, uncles and cousins as can be expected to meet.

904,"One of China's most popular folk arts is paper cutting . Archaeological  finds trace the tradition back to the 6thcentury; it is supposed that the beginnings of paper cutting were even a few centuries earlier. Paper cuttings are used for religious  purposes, for decoration  and as patterns . Today, paper cuttings are mainly used as decoration. They _ walls, windows, doors, columns mirrors, lamps and lanterns in homes. They are also used for decoration on presents, and are given as presents themselves. They are of special importance at festivals. At the Spring Festival for example, entrances are decorated with paper cuttings which are supposed to bring good luck. Paper cuttings are not produced by machine, but by hand. There are two kinds of paper cuttings; scissor   cuttings and knife cuttings. Scissor cuttings are fashioned with scissors. Several pieces of paper--- up to eight pieces---are fastened together. The motif  is then cut with sharp, pointed scissors. Knife cuttings are fashioned by putting several layers   of paper on a relatively soft foundation consisting of a mixture of tallow   and ashes. Following a pattern, the artist cuts the motif into the paper with a sharp knife which he usually holds vertically . The advantage of knife cuttings is that considerably more paper cuttings can be made in one operation than scissor cuttings. In the countryside, paper cuttings are usually made only by women and girls. This used to be one of the skills that every girl was to master and that were often used to judge brides . Professional paper cutting artists are, on the other hand, almost always men who have guaranteed   incomes and work together in workshops.

906,"The old saying that practice makes perfect seems to make no sense when it comes to schoolwork. Many educators today are looking for evidence to support the case for homework, but are coming up empty-handed. Mary Jane Cera is the academic administrator for the Kino School, and she maintains a no-homework policy across all grades. The purpose of the policy is to make sure learning remains a joy, not a thing that discourages social time and creative activity. At the Kino school, Cera says children often choose to take their favorite parts of school home. ""A lot of what we see kids doing is practicing music with their friends, and taking experiments home to show their parents,"" she says. Surveys of Kino graduates suggest that the early control they are given over their education continues to serve them well into college. ""One of the reasons that we continue to assign much homework is our obsession   with tests, although we can agree on the importance of kids doing better on tests through proper homework to some degree,""says author Alfie Kohn. In his book The Homework Myth, Kohn points out that no study has ever found a relation between homework and academic achievement and that if kids have no choice in the matter of homework, they're not really exercising judgment, and are instead losing their sense of self-control. However, many supporters of homework argue that life is filled with things we don't like to do, and that homework teaches self-discipline, time management and other non-academic life skills.

907,"Are you feeling stressed out? Anxious? Is your mind racing in circles? Are you worried about all the things you have to get done? Here's a quick--acting trick that can make you feel better. If you are sitting at a desk, place the palm of your hand on the desk, and take a moment to focus on what the surface of the desk feels like. Is it hot or cold, rough or smooth? Put all of your attention on the sensations in your palm, on how the desk feels underneath your hand. If you are not at a desk, do the same exercise by placing your palm on any nearby object--a wall, a chair, even your opposite arm. When you are feeling stressed, your thoughts tend to take on a life of their own. You may be thinking about things you wish you had done differently in the past or worrying about things that you have to do in the future. These thoughts will make you feel anxious. The anxiety, in turn, increases the number of anxious thoughts. If you can ground yourself even for a moment in the present, you will break the cycle and feel instant relief. Paying attention to what objects in your environment feel like forces you to pay more attention to the present moment than to negative, anxiety--provoking (,)thoughts about the past or about the future. Try using your other senses too: Try closing your eyes for a second(don't try this while driving!) and breathe deeply through your nose. What do you smell? When eating, put all your attention on how your food tastes. What do you hear? What little noises are there around you that you didn't notice before? Look closely at an ordinary object.

910,"Although travelers can try dishes from around China and the globe in well-known food cities like Beijing and Shanghai, it is outside these major metropolises where a world of exciting Chinese cuisine  awaits the true foodie . With this in mind and after three years of living in China and writing about Chinese food, I started a six-month journey with my husband and two daughters. Here are four of the eight most amazing Chinese food cities I've come across so far. The list is in no particular order. 1. Chengdu, Sichuan Province Crowned as Asia's first UNESCO City of Gastronomy  in 2010, Chengdu is best-known for its fiery hot pot and spicy dishes, which are characterized by the use of Sichuan pepper and are usually layered with salty, sour and sweet flavors. There are also dishes that aren't spicy at all, such as beer-braised duck. Hot pot is as _ in the city as the smell of chili. At Zigong Delicious Hotpot, the house specialty  tiaoshui wa is a cauldron  of fiery chili  to which vegetables, noodles or other meats can be added. For a real taste of Sichuan's signature pepper, hua jiao, spend a morning at the Chengdu Spice Market where the locals sell and buy it by the sack. 2. Lanzhou, Gansu Province Synonymous in the minds of food-lovers with hand-pulled beef noodles, Lanzhou also has one of the liveliest street food night markets in China. Just west of the city center, the buzzing Zhengning Road bazaar houses more than 100 street food stalls. Available is a broad selection of hot and cold dishes with emphasis on local Hui cuisine. No trip to Lanzhou is complete without feasting on noodles at Wumule Penhui, the 2012 winners of Lanzhou's annual pulled noodle competition. The halal restaurant makes noodles spicy enough to satisfy even the most hardened heat-seekers. 3. Guangzhou, Guangdong Province The birthplace of Cantonese food, Guangzhou is thought by many as the best place to eat in China. The city of 12 million has a passionate food culture, with equal excitement reserved for the opening of a hole-in-the-wall congee joint and a high-end restaurant. The local cuisine is characterized by fresh clean flavors , seafood, barbecued meats and the wonderful tradition of yum cha, which is tea drinking accompanied by dumplings and small dishes. Congee is the way locals love to start their day, and one of the most popular vendors is Ru Xuan Sha Guo Zhou. Here, one can get a bowl of signature seafood congee any hour of the day. Roast meats are Bing Sheng's most popular order--their roast goose is marinated with five-spice, boiled, air-dried, then roasted by a flame oven to give a crisp skin. For something more home style and removed from the madness of downtown, head to Ji Cun for steamed chicken and simple farmer-style dishes. 4. Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province This ancient canal city is home to huangjiu, an amber-colored rice wine that's important in Chinese cooking. Open since 1894, the dining chain is known by almost every Chinese for its appearance in early 20th century novels by Chinese literati Lu Xun. Xianheng's delicacies include crispy-skinned chicken, smoked red dates in rice wine, beans flavored with fennel , and crispy bream in rice wine. Fried fermented tofu is also a local specialty, which is available all over town at small street stalls including one just outside Xianheng. The writer's purpose of the passage is to   _  .",share her story and impression on Chinese cuisines,tell readers how to comment on amazing Chinese food cities,talk the readers into enjoying the signature food such as hand-pulled noodles,express her preference for fiery hot pot and spicy dishes in Chengdu.,A
911,"July 21st. 2007 was a typical English summer's day--it rained for 24 hours! As usual, I rushed home from work at midday to check on the house. Nothing was _ . By the time I left work at 5p.m., however, the road into our village was flooded. Our house had never been flooded but, as I opened the front door, a wave of waters greeted me. Thank God! The kids weren't with me, because the house was 5 feet deep in water. We lost everything downstairs. And the plaster had to be torn off the wall's ceilings pulled down. At first we tried to push on through. We didn't want to move the children out of home. So we camped upstairs. We put a sheet of plastic across the floor to protect us from the damp. But after three months, we felt very sick, so we move to a wooden house in a park. The house was small, but at first we were all just delighted to be in a new place. Unfortunately, things took longer than expected and we were there for 10 months. The life there was inconvenient. What surprised me most was how much I missed being part of a community . We had lived in a friendly village with good neighbors, and I'd never thought how much I'd miss that. Although our situation was very bad, it's difficult to feel too sorry for yourself when you look at what's happening elsewhere. I watched a news report about floods in Northern India and thought. ""We didn't have a straw hut that was for Christmas. But I can't wait--I'm going to throw a party for our friends in the village to say thanks for their support. This year, I won't need any gifts--living away from home for months has made me realize how little we actually need or miss all our possessions. Although we are replacing things, there's really no rush--we have our home back. And that's the main thing.

913,"When I was seven years old, my family made me an ant farm. First, we put clean sand in a thin glass box. Then we waited for the ants to arrive. After the ants were in the glass farm, they started to make tunnels . I was amazed that each one knew exactly what to do. Each had its own job. On the fifth day a tragedy  happened. I put my face so close to the glass farm that I knocked it over. All the tunnels fell down. Although the ants remained alive after their earthquake, one by one began to die. I was scared as I watched them give up building their tunnels to carry the bodies to a corner the farm. My mother said that the ants were dying of sadness. They simply could not stand that their tunnels were gone. Although much time has passed, I still think of that ant farm. Mom had hoped it would teach me about the natural world, but it taught me much more. Over the years, I came to realize the importance of teamwork. Working together, the ants were able to make an amazing world for themselves. I also learned that they should be admired for their hard work. But there was an even larger lesson that I did not realize until recently: Adversity  is a natural part of life, and must be accepted. Unlike the ants, we cannot give up when we are sad. We have to realize that if a tunnel is gone, we must build another. Giving up, I say, is not a good choice. Among the following events, which one happened first?",All the tunnels fell down.,The ants died one by one.,The ants got into the glass box.,The ants began making tunnels.,C
914,"Today's word, pan, takes us back to the days of the gold rush in California. On January 24th, 1848, a man named James Wilson Marshall discovered gold in California. The news spread quickly. Thousands rushed west. They traveled on foot, on horseback and by boat to reach the gold fields. By 1849, the great gold rush was on. Towns and cities grew overnight. Throughout California --- in the mountains, along the streams and rivers --- thousands of people searched for gold. Some found areas of mountain rock thick with gold. These men got rich. But such areas were few and quickly claimed by the first men to find them. Others searched for gold in the rivers coming down the mountains. They were after pieces of gold that the rains had washed down from above . The only way to find this gold was by panning. First a gold miner put dirt in a metal pan and added water. Then he shook the pan so that the water would wash the dirt. Slowly, he poured the water out of the pan. If he was a lucky miner, pieces of gold would remain. Across the nation, newspapers carried stories of the gold being found. Each one hoped that the place he claimed panned out well --- had some gold. For many, gold mining did not pan out. For a few, it panned out well. But in time, huge machines were built that could wash many tons of dirt at a time. Panning died out. The word, however, remained in the language. Today, Americans still say, "" It panned out well ,"" when something they have done pleases them. A business, a discovery, a simple event pans out well if it is successful. Unhappily, sometimes things do not pan out. In recent years, the word pan has taken on another meaning. Today, it also means to criticize. How it got this meaning is hard to discover. But the job of a critic is to sometimes pan the work of a writer, artist or singer. Why did so many people flood to California in 1848?",Because towns and cities there developed quickly.,Because the mountains in California were a great place for travel.,Because they wanted to get rich by looking for gold.,Because the land of California was fertile at that time.,C
915,"There was simply too much news and too much information freely available on the net.But was it accurate? Whose opinion should we trust? A survey found that 60% of UK adults think it is worth paying for a ""good newspaper"", and most of those said they believed more of what they read in the paid-for newspapers. Here was something newspapers understood--here was what they could offer: news plus comment and opinion. And the Internet now offered opportunities.A newspaper was just that: news printed on paper.But the Internet now offered newspapers different places to print, and in different media. This may explain why the readership of newspapers online in the UK is very different from people who read printed newspapers. The most popular newspaper in the UK is The Sun and is also the most popular newspaper in the world.The ""mid--market"" audience mainly reads The Daily Mail.Of the ""quality"" newspapers, the most popular is the Daily Telegraph.

916,"Like any awards ceremony of its age, the Oscars, now in its 85th year, has been trying hard to change. So how did that go this year? When host Seth MacFarlane noted in his opening speech that it was the first time the Academy Awards had a theme, I thought: ""well, that's a good start."" But when he revealed that the theme was a tribute to(...) musicals, I was less sure. After all, it's not the first time that musicals have featured at the Oscars. In 2007, the cast of Dream-girls gave a special performance directed by movie director and musical veteran  Bill Condon. Then there was the memorable 2009 show hosted by Hugh Jackman, who screams musicals. With Beyonce Knowles and Anne Hathaway, he performed several hit songs from move musical. And in 2010, how did Neil Patrick Harris introduce the hosts? By performing a musical number. So I guess the Oscars could have done better this year. But I must admit, there were more music performances in the three-and-a -half-hour show than ever before. This suggests the Oscars has dropped some of its arrogance and wants to offer audiences more entertainment. It's a timely move as the Golden Globes, also known as the ""big party,"" has become a threat to the Oscars, stealing viewers and even its reputation. Just look at the Oscars' winning list this year. You can't blame the academy for wanting to stick it to the Golden Globes. While they hired Tina Fey and Amy Poehler to host the show--certainly more audience-friendly than MacFarlane-- and Bill Clinton was invited as a presenter, who did viewers get at the Oscars? The First Lady of the US, Michelle Obama. Way to go, Oscar! We know you're struggling to look fresh and young, but don't lose the pride and dignity that made you one biggest honor in the movie industry. Don't ever let that change. Which of the following is true of the Golden Globes?","It gave an award to the First Lady of the US, Michelle Obama.",Its host and hostess had better reputation.,It has become highly competitive with the Academy Awards.,It is more friendly to the audience.,C

918,"A turkey named Courage gave thanks to President Obama for saving his life on the day before Thanksgiving. Honouring a 62-year-old tradition, the President pardoned the bird on Thanksgiving eve. The tradition of a turkey pardon at Thanksgiving began with President Truman in 1947. Courage comes from Ellsworth, Iowa. The name Courage was chosen by voters  who took part in a survey posted on the White House website. The lucky turkey walked on the lawn of the Rose Garden and posed for the cameras at the presidential podium . The dinner that has become known as the First Thanksgiving was actually a harvest festival celebrated in December of 1621. That's when English settlers in Plymouth, Massachusetts, gave thanks for the progress they had made after a hard winter in their new country. As America grew, Thanksgiving customs also spread and got bigger. George Washington declared that the first national Thanksgiving would be on November 26, 1789. In the decades to follow, however, people celebrated Thanksgiving locally, with no official date. President Abraham Lincoln declared the last Thursday in November 1863 a national day of Thanksgiving. It stayed that way until 1939, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved it one week earlier. He wanted to lengthen the shopping period before Christmas to encourage gift-buyers and to help businesses. So Congress  ruled that, after 1941, Thanksgiving would be an official federal holiday falling on the fourth Thursday of November. This year we celebrated Thanksgiving on Thursday, November. Millions of Americans got together to give thanks with friends and family. The lucky turkey, Courage, was one of them. After his pardon, Courage would be sent to Disneyland Resort in California, where he would be the grand assemble of Disney's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The first Thanksgiving Day was held to   _  .",celebrate the harvest of British settlers,celebrate the progress of Americans,encourage the struggle with British settlers,celebrate the joy of all Americans after a hard winter,A
919,"Cancer researchers urged people on Wednesday to take more vitamin D to lower risk of cancer, saying studies showed a clear link. ""Our suggestion is for people to increase their intake, through diet or a vitamin supplement,"" Dr. Cedric Garland said in a telephone interview. Garland's research team reviewed 63 studies, including several large long-term ones, on the relationship between vitamin D and certain types of cancer worldwide between 1966 and 2004. ""There's nothing that has this ability to prevent cancer,"" he said, urging governments and public health officials to do more to fortify foods with vitamin D.Garland is part of a University of California at San Diego Moores Cancer Center team that published its findings this week online in the American Journal of Public Health.    Vitamin D is found in milk, as well as in some fortified orange juice, yogurt and cheeses, usually at around 100 international units (IU) a serving. People might want to consider a vitamin supplement to raise their intake to 1000 IUs per day, Garland said, adding that it was well within the safety guidelines established by the National Academy of Sciences. The authors said that taking more vitamin D could be especially important for people living in northern areas, which receive less vitamin D from sunshine. African Americans, who don't produce as much of the vitamin because of their skin colour, could also benefit significantly from a higher intake, the authors said. Which of the following can not help people get more Vitamin D?",Have more meat,Have some sunshine,Have a vitamin supplement,Have more fortified cheese,A

But one thing is very different: He's become a celebrity in cyberspace almost overnight, after his pictures, which show what the smog in Beijing looks like under his microscope, spread like a virus on China's major micro-blogging site Sina Weibo, since he posted them last Friday.Now the media is always interviewing him. Zhang's apartment is on the eighth floor, which he says is perfect for capturing the thickest levels of smog. As a Beijing native, Zhang explains his original purpose is to _ and expose its mystery.""

A friend, a classmate, a teacher or a boss? Be sure the tone  of your e-mail message is right for the receiver. Using slang  or abbreviations  may be all right for your friends. But business letters should use full names and complete sentences. (2)     Be direct. Readers of e-mail have little patience. Say what you want to say directly. (3)     Use short sentences.  E-mail is quicker and more convenient than snail mail. It's also much easier to throw away. Don't use long sentences. Make your sentences short and clear. (4) Give enough details .  A terrible e-mail message reads like this: ""Did you get my e-mail?"" Someone reading this will wonder, ""Which e-mail? Sent when? About what?"" Today's e-mail users sometimes get many messages every day, so be sure your messages have enough details to be understood. (5) Use the subject line  well Readers see what's in the subject line of your message before anything else. Don't say ""Hi, from Wang Peng""------ they can see who sent the message from the address. A short, direct explanation of the content  of your message will get you a faster answer. (6) Don't be too slow to answer. Remember that in the world of e-mail, things happen fast.

I think that these meals are not healthy. We can have some rice with some vegetables or meat. More healthy fish and poultry  slowly _ beef and pork. It's healthy to drink one glass of water, juice or tea after each meal. At six or seven in the evening, it's time for dinner. At this time, family members usually get together.

A green building means not only the colour of the paint. Also,it refers to environmentally friendly houses,factories and offices. Green building means ""reducing the impact  of the building on the land"", Taryn Holowka of the US Green Building Council in Washington D.C.said. According to Holowka,buildings account for 65 percent of total US electricity use.  But green buildings can reduce energy and water use. Also,the buildings are often located near public transportation such as buses and subways,so that people can drive their cars less.That could be good for the environment,because cars use lots of gas and give off pollution. Green buildings are often built on developed land,so that the buildings don't destroy forests. Marty Dettling is the project manager for a building that put these ideas into action.The Solaire has been called the country's first green highrise building.  According to Dettling,""We've reduced our energy use by onethird and our water by 50 percent."" The Solaire cuts energy in part by using solar power.""On the surface of the building we have solar panels which change the sun's energy into electricity,""Dettling explained. The Solaire also has lights that automatically turn off when people leave the room. In addition,the building has lots of windows,allowing people to use the sun for light during the day.The Solaire cuts water by reusing it. Not everyone is eager to move into a green building,however. Some people think that things like solar panels cost more money than more traditional energy source. Anyhow,Holowka said,""It is going to take off."" The main idea of the passage may be   _  .    .",settling designed the first green building in the US,energy shortage calls for buildings of new design,the Solaire serves as a model of high buildings,green buildings help save environment,D
934,"Kathy started at my nursery school at the age of three. She settled into the group easily, and would be first on the slide and highest up the climbing frame. She could put on her coat without help and not only fasten her own buttons but other children's too. She was a lovely child but unfortunately a scratcher. If anyone upset her or stood in her way, her right hand would flash out fast and scratch down the face of her playmates. Children twice her age would fly in fear from her. This must have been very rewarding for Kathy but obviously it had to be stopped. All the usual ways failed and then I remembered and account by G. Atkinson of prefix = st1 /HighfieldSchool, of how fights in the playground had been stopped. No punishment had been given, but the attacker had been ignored and the victims rewarded. So I decided to try this out on Kathy. With a pocketful of Smarties I followed Kathy around. She was so quick that it was impossible to prevent her scratching, but I was determined to stay within arm's length all afternoon. All was peaceful but then I saw Kathy's hand moved and heard the scream. Gently I gathered up the little hurt one in my arms and said ""Nice, nice sweetie"" and I put a Smartie into her mouth. Kathy opened her mouth, expecting a Smartie and then looked puzzled when she got nothing. Soon came another scream, this time from John. While holding him in my arms, I said, ""Look, Kathy, a nice Smartie for John"" and put it into John's mouth. A smile of understanding flashed across Kathy's face, Minutes later, she came to me and said loudly, ""Give me a Smartie! I have hurt my finger!"" ""No,"" I replied, ""you'll get it if someone hurts you."" On purpose, she turned and scratched a nearby boy. Tom, and waited quietly while I mothered and rewarded him, then she walked away. She has never scratched a child since. Parents who find older children  _ younger brothers and sisters might do well to replace shouting and punishment by rewarding and more attention to the injured ones. It's certainly much easier and more effective. Kathy scratched Tom because_.","she was angry at Tom, who was in her way",she wanted to get a Smartie from the teacher,she was in the habit of scratching other children,she wanted to know if the teacher meant what she had said,D

936,"Being lonely in the crowd might seem ridiculous. But according to a recent survey, the situation is all too common. Loneliness and other anxiety problems - worrying about life's pressures - can even lead to self-murder.          An article in China Daily gave no reason for this other than the usual blaming of the post-80s generation. According to a high level official, young people suffering from discouragement are mostly ""spoiled and have not been taught to be independent, responsible and express 'thank-you'."" Well, how do you like that? First, I don't think China's youth are exactly spoiled. They certainly have more things than their parents did, but a lot of the money spent on them is for their education including various extra classes.          Discouragement and anxiety are now the fastest growing challenges in modern societies. We sense a lack of close friends who can talk to honestly and openly. In 1985, a US study found that one in ten people did not have such a friend. In 2006, it was one in four. It's easy to see the connection between loneliness and discouragement. But what actually causes this increasing loneliness?          Surely, with Internet social networking sites such as Kaixin, we have more friends than ever. A new study has shown that the more time teenagers spend in front of computers, the less close they are to friends and family.Kaixinor QQ may be fun but it lacks meaning, compared to personal connections in the real world.          And then there are those endless online games popular with young Chinese but increasingly there are more interesting choices. For example, new sports such as skateboarding are starting to catch on in bigger cities, as is playing music in a band. These creative hobbies are done in a group and thus friendship can be stronger. Hopefully young people will also be drawn out of the Internet cafes and interactive computer games that in fact fail to recreate a real and interactive experience. According to the text, which of the following can help us avoid being lonely in the crowd?",To stay long in Internet cafes.,To play music in a band.,To abandon our own hobbies.,To focus on extra courses.,B

942,"Scientists found that sleeping considerably improves our creativity. After taking a nap people are able to think faster and put more imagination into their thinking. Besides, if we dream, the thinking abilities are improved even more. Researchers consider that sleeping on a problem in most cases leads to elucidation . They say when a person enters a phase called Rapid Eye Movement (REM) during sleep, _ increases the effect. Such phase takes place right before we awake and according to scientists it helps our brain make links between unrelated subjects. In the study, led by Professor Sara Mednick, scientists made a conclusion that the REM was ""important for assimilating  new information into past experience"" in order to find solutions to creative problems. Prof. Mednick is a psychiatrist at the University of California. Her study involved the analysis of 77 adults. Each participant was given several word-associated creative tasks. All tasks were given in the morning, with participants being shown a number of groups of 3 words, for example: cookie, heart and sixteen. They were asked to come up with a word that would be associated with all three given terms--like sweet. Sometime later, after some participants were allowed to sleep, they were asked to perform the same tasks and some new ones. It is worth mentioning that while some people slept, researchers used brain scans to see the type of sleep each participant entered. When given the same tasks, participants, who took a nap, were able to give more varied solutions, some of which were much better than they gave earlier. But when given new tasks, researchers found that those who entered REM sleep had a 40 percent better result compared to the performance they showed in the morning.

946,"Imagine living in a city made of glass. No, this isn't a fairy tale. If you could grab your diving gear and swim down 650 feet into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Washington State, you would witness the secret world of glass reefs. The reef you'd be looking at is made up of glass sponges . But how can animals be made of glass? Well, glass is formed from a substance called silica. The sponges use the silica found in ocean waters to build glass structures that will give them shape and support. Be careful! Some of the fragile creatures are up to 200 years old. When sponges die, new ones grow on top of the pile of old ones. Over centuries, a massive and complex reef takes shape. Some sponges look like wrinkled trumpets, while others look like overgrown cauliflower or mushrooms. Dr. Paul Johnson, who discovered the Washington reef in 2007, also found other surprises such as bubbles of methane  gas flowing out of the seafloor nearby. The methane feeds bacteria, and the bacteria feed the glass sponges. ""It's a new ecosystem we know nothing about,"" said Dr. Johnson. The reef of yellow and orange glass sponges is crowded with crabs, shrimp, starfish, worms, snails, and rockfish. The glass reef is also a nursery for the babies of many of these creatures and was called a ""kindergarten"" by scientists. Many animals that live in the reef hang around for a long time, just like the sponges. Rockfish, for example, live for more than 100 years. Scientists are just beginning to study all the species that call the reef home. The Washington coast isn't the only place where a living glass reef has been found. The first was discovered in Hecate Strait off the coast of British Columbia in 1991. Scientists all over the world were to see it.

948,"In modern society there is a great deal of argument about competition. Some value it highly, believing that it is responsible  for social progress. Others say that competition is bad; that it sets one person against another; that it leads to unfriendly relationship between people. I have taught many children who held the belief that their self-worth depended on how well they performed at tennis and other skills. For them, playing well and winning are often life-and-death affairs . The development of many other human qualities is sadly forgotten. However, while some seem to be lost in the desire to succeed, others take an opposite attitude. In a culture which values only the winner and pays no attention to the common players, they are strongly against competition. Most of them are young people who have suffered under competitive pressures from their parents or society. Teaching these youngsters, I often observe  in them a desire to fail. They seem to find failure by not trying to win or achieve success. By not trying, they always have an excuse: "" I may have lost, but it doesn't matter because I really didn't try."" What is not usually accepted by themselves is the belief that if they had really tried and lost, that would mean a lot. Such a loss would be a measure  of their worth. Clearly, this belief is the same as that of true competitors who try to prove themselves. Both are based on the mistaken belief that one's self-worth depends on how well one performs in the competition. Both are afraid of not being valued. We can discover a new meaning in competition only as this kind of fear begins to disappear. What does this passage mainly talk about?",Competition helps to set up self-respect.,Opinions about competition are different among people.,Competition is harmful to personal quality development.,Failures are necessary experience in competition.,B

Waves are one of nature 's ways of picking up energy and then sending it off on a journey.        When waves come toward the shore, people can set up dams to block the water and send it through a large wheel called a turbine   .The turbine can then power an electrical generator to produce electricity .        ""The resource is huge,"" said Janet Swain of the World watch Institute.""We will never run out of wave power."" Besides, wave energy does not create the same pollution as other energy sources, such as oil or coal.Oceans cover three-quarters of the Earth's surface - that would make wave power seem ideal for creating energy throughout the world, though there are some weak points yet to overcome.        Swain said that wave power still costs too much money.She also said that its effects on sea animals are still unknown.What is more, wave power could affect fishing and boat traffic.        Traditional sources of energy like oil and gas may someday run out."" Demand for energy to power our TVs and computers, drive our cars, and heat and cool our homes is rising rapidly throughout the world,"" Swain said.In the future when you turn on a light, an ocean wave could be providing the electricity!

950,"FDA proposed the most sweeping food safety rules in decades, requiring farmers and food companies to be more cautious in the wake of deadly outbreaks in peanuts, cantaloupe  ,and leafy greens. The long-overdue regulations are aimed at reducing the estimated 3,000 deaths a year from foodbome illness. Just since last summer, outbreaks of listeria  in cheese and salmonella in peanut butter, cantaloupe and mangoes have been linked to more than 400 illnesses and as many as seven deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The actual number of those sickened is likely much higher. The FDA's proposed rules would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination  ,to include making sure workers5 hands are washed, irrigation   water is clean, and that animals stay out of fields. Food manufacturers will have to submit food safety plans to the government to show _ are keeping their operations clean. Many responsible food companies and farmers are already following the steps that the FDA would now require them to take. But officials say the requirements could have saved lives and prevented illnesses in some of the large-scale outbreaks that have hit the country in recent years. In a 2011 outbreak of listeria in cantaloupe that claimed 33 lives ,for example, FDA inspectors found pools of dirty water on the floor and old, dirty processing equipment at the Colorado farm where the cantaloupes were grown. In a peanut butter outbreak this year linked to 42 salmonella illnesses ,inspectors found samples of salmonella throughout a New Mexico peanut processing plant and multiple obvious safety problems ,such as birds flying over uncovered trucks of peanuts and employees not washing their hands. Under the new rules, companies would have to lay out plans for preventing those sorts of problems and how they would correct them.

Though he was tired,Howe slept badly.He turned and turned.Then he had a dream.He dreamt that he had been caught by terrible savages whose king wanted to kill him and eat him unless he could build a perfect sewing machine.When he tried to do so,Howe ran into the same problem as before.The thread kept getting caught around the needle.The king flew into the cage and ordered his soldiers to kill Howe.They came up towards him with their spears raised.But suddenly the inventor noticed something.There was a hole in the tip of each spear.The inventor awoke from the dream,realizing that he had just found the answer to the problem.Instead of trying to get the thread to run around the needle,he should make it run through a small hole in the center of the needle.This was the simple idea that finally made Howe design and build the first really practical sewing machine. Elias Howe was not the only one in finding the answer to his problem in this way.Thomas Edison,the inventor of the electric light,said his best ideas came into him in dreams.So did the great physicist Albert Einstein.Charlotte Bronte also drew in her dreams in writing Jane Eyre. To know the value of dreams,you have to understand what happens when you are asleep.Even then,a part of your mind is still working.This unconscious ,but still active part understands your experiences and goes to work on the problems you have had during the day.It stores all sorts of information that you may have forgotten or never have really noticed.It is only when you fall asleep that this part of the brain can send messages to the part you use when you are awake.However,the unconscious part acts in a special way.It uses strange images which the conscious part may not understand at first.This is why dreams are sometimes called ""secret messages to ourselves "". Dreams are sometimes called ""secret messages to ourselves"" because   _  .",strange images are used to communicate ideas,images which have no meaning are used,we can never understand the real meaning,only specially trained people can understand them,A
953,"One windy spring day, I observed young people having fun using the wind to fly their kites. Multicolored creations of varying shapes and sizes filled the skies like beautiful birds dashing and dancing in the exciting atmosphere above the earth. As the strong winds gusted against the kites, a string kept them in check. Instead of blowing away with the wind, they arose against it to achieve great heights. They shook and pulled, but the controlling string and the clumsy tail kept them in tow , facing upward and against the wind. As the kites struggled and trembled against the string, they seemed to say, ""Let me go! Let me go! I want to be free!"" They flew beautifully even as they fought the forced restriction of the string. Finally, one of the kites succeeded in breaking loose. ""Free at last,"" it seemed to say. ""Free to fly with the wind."" Yet freedom from control simply put it at the mercy of an unsympathetic gentle wind. It flew ungracefully to the ground and landed in a twisted mass of weeds and string against a dead bush. ""Free at last"". Free to lie powerless in the dirt, to be blown helplessly along the ground, and to settle down lifeless against the first roadblock. How much like kites we sometimes are. There always exist misfortunes and restrictions, rules to follow from which we can grow and gain strength. Prohibition is a necessary counterpart to the winds of opposition. Some of us pulled at the rules so hard that we never fly fast to reach the heights we might have obtained. If we keep all the commandment , we will never rise high enough to get our tails off the ground. Let us each rise to the great heights, recognizing that some of the prohibitions are actually the steady force that helps us climb and achieve. What is the purpose of the author in writing this passage?",To give up tips on how to fly kites effectively.,To warn us that freedom is actually powerless.,To explain that restrictions are really unnecessary.,To teach us a lesson that rules are important in life.,D
954,"Time spent in a bookshop can be most enjoyable, whether you are a booklover or merely go there to buy a book as a present. You may even have entered the shop just to find shelter from a sudden shower. Whatever the reason, you can soon become totally unaware of your surroundings. The desire to pick up a book with an attractive _ is irresistible, although this method of selection ought not to be followed, as you might end up with a rather dull book. You soon become absorbed in some book or other, and usually it is only much later that you realize you have spent far too much time there and must dash off to keep some forgotten appointment--without buying a book, of course. This opportunity to escape the realities of everyday life is, I think, the main attraction of a bookshop. There are not many places where it is possible to do this. A music shop is very much like a bookshop. You can wander round such places to your heart's content. If it is a good shop, no assistant will approach you with the unavoidable greeting: ""Can I help you, sir?"" You needn't buy anything you don't want. In a bookshop an assistant should remain in the background until you have finished browsing. Then, and only then, are his services necessary. Of course, you may want to find out where a particular section is, but when he has led you there, the assistant should retire considerately and look as if he is not interested in selling a single book. You have to be careful not to be attracted by the variety of books in a bookshop. It is very easy to enter the shop looking for a book on, say ancient coins and to come out carrying a copy of the latest bestselling novel and perhaps a book about brass-rubbing--something which had only slightly interested you up till then. This volume on the subject, however, happened to be so well illustrated and the part of the text you read proved so interesting that you just had to buy it. This sort of thing can be very dangerous. Apart from running up a huge account, you can waste a great deal of time wandering from section to section. You may spend too much time in a bookshop because  _  .",the dust jackets are very attractive,you start reading one of the books,it is raining outside,you have to make sure you won't buy a dull book as a present,B

956,"At least once each winter I manage to get a good flight in the middle of a snowstorm. Last Sunday was that flight. My gliding  partners had looked at the weather reports of showers and decided to stay at home. People say that you shouldn't fly by yourself, but on that day I felt the urge to go flying and so headed for my favorite gliding site. I had the mountain ridge to myself. After a smooth lift-off, I floated stably in the breeze, feeling at peace with myself and the world. I looked across the valley to Bedford and a moment later saw the town disappear in a band of snow that was moving towards me. The breeze remained strong enough for flying and I knew that as long as the _ was good, it was OK for me to stay in the air. The snow moved in and swirled around me. It was a light dry snow. The day was already very quiet but, somehow, the light snow made it even more silent. I felt like a snowflake. Two bald eagles joined me. They didn't pay me any attention and spent a few minutes flying around the ridge before disappearing. I flew through another band of snow. I had been flying for about 45 minutes when I next looked across the valley. I could see there were more bands of snow to come and the breeze was dying too. It was time to go home, get in a hot bath and warm up. I couldn't wait to tell my gliding partners that they had missed out on a perfect flight.

957,"How much empathy do you feel towards other people? If you saw someone fall off their bike in traffic,would you stop and help--or just walk away? Many people would give in to coldness,go about their business and just do nothing.So it was a big surprise when about  100 bystanders got together recently to move a bus in east London to help a cyclist trapped under it.A video of the incident went viral on social media. According to Zoheb,a driver who stopped his car to take part in the rescue,about five  people gathered to move the bus.He says:""There was no chance we could do it,it was more  an invitation for other people to help,really."" The initiative paid off.Diners from nearby restaurants joined in.There wasn't much coordination but it didn't take long to develop a collective understanding of what the  objective was. Spontaneous cooperation among strangers doesn't happen often.People in a  crowd are not sure what to do--they don't have a plan.It's one of the reasons bystanders often do nothing,according to Dr Mark Levine,professor of social psychology at Exeter University in Britain.""The presence of others can prevent you from helping"",he says. The key to positive group behaviour,Levine explains,""is building a sense of shared identity"".Action has to be decided quickly,Levine says.""The longer you leave it,the harder it is to make a decision.If you don't immediately act then you kind of think'Well,actually I probably couldn't have done anything anyway'."" But the people who took the initiative like Zoheb might make a difference.The cyclist ended up in hospital and the images of the collective effort might inspire others to more acts of unity. Which of the following best describes the driver Zoheb according to the text?",Generous.,Kind-hearted.,Optimistic.,Easy-going.,B
958,"Taiwan police cannot decide whether to treat it as an extremely clever act of stealing or an even cleverer cheat .Either way, it could be a perfect crime , because the criminals are birds----homing pigeons. The crime begins with a telephone message to the owner of a stolen car: if you want the car back, pay some money. Then, the car owner is directed to a park, told where to find a bird cage and how to attach money to the neck of the pigeon inside. Carrying the money in a tiny bag, the pigeon flies off. There have been at least four such pigeon pick-ups in Changwa. What at first seemed like the work of a clever stay-at-home car thief, however, may in fact be the work of an even lazier and more inventive criminal mind---- one that avoids  not only collecting money but going out to steal the car in the first place. Police officer Chen says that the criminal probably has pulled a double trick: he gets money for things he cannot possibly return. Instead of stealing cars, he lets someone else do it and then waits for the car owner to place an ad in the newspaper asking for help. The theory is supportd by the fact that, so far,none of the stolen cars have been returned. Also, the amount of money demanded----under 3,000 Taiwanese dollars-----seems too little for a car worth many times more. Demands for pigeon-delivered money stopped as soon as the press reported the story. And even if they start again, Chen holds little hope of catching the criminal. ""We have more important things to do,""he said. The writer mentions the fact that ""none of the stolen cars have been returned"" to show   _  .",how easily people get fooled by criminals,what Chen thinks might be correct.,the thief is extremely clever.,the money paid is too little.,B
959,"Wanda, the neighborhood witch, was a good witch and had been one for about 221 years. Her fondest dream was to become a fairy godmother. She had been going to the Fairy Godmother Academy for 103 years, learning fairy godmother magic: how to turn pumpkins into coaches, how to make things vanish in clouds of smoke, even how to change mice into horses and footmen. Just that very morning the principal of the Academy had said Wanda was ready for her final test. She was to change the first animal she met into something else. The animal was to be so happy at becoming whatever it became that it would say, ""Oh, happy day! I'm a..."" If it did, Wanda would pass the test. She would become a fairy godmother, with a sparkling pink dress, a golden crown, and a magic wand tipped with a shining star. However, if she failed, she would have to start school all over again--all 103 years of it. ""Good luck,"" the principal said as Wanda left the Academy. The very first animal Wanda bumped into was Charley, a little green frog who sat in a pond by the side of the road catching bugs with his long, sticky tongue and croaking ""Baroomp! Baroomp!"" When Charley saw Wanda he jumped onto a lily pad. ""Hi,"" he cried. ""Witch way are you going? Ha, ha. That's a joke, Wanda. 'Witch way are you going?' Get it?"" ""I get it, Charley,"" replied Wanda, ""but it's not much of a joke. Anyway, I'm glad you're here. I have a surprise for you. You'll be so happy."" Then, without even an ""if you please,"" Wanda waved her wand, said a magic word, and poof  ! Charley, the little green frog, turned into a prince! He was a handsome prince but a wet one. The lily pad had collapsed under his weight and dumped him into the water. Charley-turned-prince stood up and looked at his reflection in the water. ""Hey!"" he cried. ""You turned me into a prince! It's a surprise all right, but I don't want to be a prince. I want to be a frog! Change me back right now!"" ""Oh, dear,"" Wanda said. ""You know I don't like to be yelled at, Charley. Now you've made me forget the reverse spell. But who wouldn't rather be a prince than a frog?"" ""I wouldn't!"" cried Charley. ""I want to be a frog!"" He stuck out his tongue, missing a bug flying by the end of his nose. ""Look at that, Wanda! I was such a good fly catcher. And I had eyes on top of my head, too. I could see forward and backward and sideways all at once, but look at me now. With my eyes in front of my face, I can only see one direction at a time. I don't even have a castle, Wanda. What kind of prince is that? I'd really rather be a frog. Please change me back!"" ""I can't, Charley. But you'll learn to be happy as a prince. As for a castle, I can take care of that."" She waved her wand, and suddenly a castle appeared by the banks of the pond. It had stone walls, oaken doors, and pennants waving from its turrets. ""Your very own palace, Charley! You'll have servants, eat fancy foods and ice cream."" ""Bah!"" Charley interrupted. ""Who wants servants, or ice cream and fancy foods? I want bugs!"" He stuck out his tongue and looked down his nose at it, cross-eyed. ""This tongue is no good--it's too short!"" he cried. ""I can't even see it."" Again Wanda waved her wand. ""Look, Charley, musicians,"" she said. Out of the castle marched dozens of musicians blowing trumpets, tootling flutes, and banging drums. ""See? Your own band. They'll play music, and you can sing and dance and snap your fingers to your heart's content."" ""I don't want to sing and dance!"" Charley cried. ""And why would I do something as silly as snapping my fingers?"" ""Snapping fingers!"" exclaimed Wanda. ""That's it, Charley. That's what I forgot!"" She snapped her fingers, cried ""Upsi-doodle!"" and poof! The castle and musicians disappeared and the prince became a little green frog. Charley hopped onto a lily pad. He looked at himself in the water. ""You did it, Wanda. Oh, happy day! I'm a frog."" Wanda smiled and thought to herself, ""So I have to go back to school for another 103 years. Who cares? Charley's happy, and that's what really counts."" Well, it wasn't exactly 'Oh, happy day! I'm a prince,' but the principal of the Fairy Godmother Academy decided that 'Oh, happy day! I'm a frog' was close enough. Wanda hadn't thought about herself. She had only wanted to make Charley happy. Thinking about others was the most important thing fairy godmothers had to do. The principal waved her magic wand. Look! Wanda the Witch became Wanda the Fairy Godmother...sparkling pink dress, magic wand with a star, and all. By thinking ""So I have to go back to school for another 103 years"", Wanda thought   _  .",she failed the test,she made the frog unhappy,she would be punished by the principal,she needed to improve her skill,A

Xu Zijiao, 21, a student at Sichuan University, often buys clothes on Taobao. ""The colors might be different. And since you can't feel the clothes, the quality might be bad,"" Xu said. Many people had similar experiences to Xu - buying something that isn't as good as the advertisements suggest, or going into a store for a special offer but still paying a lot.

963,"Years ago a farmer owned land along the Atlantic. He constantly advertised for hired hands. Most people were not willing to work on farms along the Atlantic because they worried about the terrible storms that destroy buildings and crops. The farmer received a steady stream of refusals at the interview for a farmhand Finally, a short, thin man approached the farmer. ""Are you a good farmhand?"" the farmer asked him. ""Well, I can sleep when the wind blows. "" answered the little man. Although puzzled by this answer ,the farmer, desperate for help, hired him. The little man worked well around the farm ,busy from dawn to dusk, and the farmer felt satisfied with the man's work. Then one night the wind howled loudly from offshore.

964,"It is obvious that television brings us not only advantages but also disadvantages .    At first, television is both a convenient channel of amusement, and a  ly cheap one. If we have a TV set in the family, we are not necessary to go to the cinema or theatre to enjoy programme with expensive tickets. All that they have to do is press a button with a finger, and they can watch all the programmes they like, such as TV talk shows , movies, opera and so on. But some people think of it as a danger. When we watch TV, we don't need to do anything . We do not even have to leave our sofa because we have a remote control in our hand. We don't need to make any judgment or statement about it. We are totally passive and don't use our head to think hard about some matters.    As we all know, television keeps us informed about world events--including all the events in society, science and politics .We can get a good idea of the most remote countries and the strangest customs in their country. Of course the radio performs this service too, but the effect of the programme is not better than on the television. Everything we enjoy on the television is much more vivid and realistic. However, in turn there is a great danger. Usually we cannot resist the television screen, because it has a great harm for us. We have been so accustomed to enjoying the screen, so dependent on its pictures. But when our TV sets are out of order, we are surprised to find that we have much more time to do things. And at this time we actually begin to have a talk to each other again. It is really worth thinking.    Of course the arguments about the advantages and disadvantages of television are on the go.We can not simply say television itself is good or bad. The truth is that how we use it determines its true value to our society. Why are some people against TV?",Because TV programs are not interesting.,Because TV viewers are completely passive.,Because TV prices are very high.,Because TV has both advantages and disadvantages.,B

966,"Little Lopsy fluttered  into our home and our hearts one Saturday morning this summer. My husband went out to do something, and when he opened the door there was a great flutter on the ground and something came into the living room. It was clear that whatever it was was hurt. I was in a bit of a shock and didn't know what to do next. Fortunately it calmed down and tried to hide itself in a corner. I realized it was a sparrow chick . There are a few sparrow nests under the roof of our apartment, and this little fellow must have fallen out and hurt itself. It was also very young, and obviously far from ready to leave the safety of the nest. I ran to the place and found a box. Having read somewhere that one shouldn't touch a baby bird with one's hands, I picked the chick up with a hand towel and put it in the box. I placed the box outside the front door in the hope that the parents would try to feed it. They never came near it and I brought it inside. I placed the box on a table and it slept for about twenty hours. We later learned that it is quite normal for a hurt bird to sleep so much after undergoing such a hurt experience. When it finally woke up we carefully examined it for wounds, but fortunately there wasn't any. It had hurt its right wing and leg, which meant it must have landed on its right side when it fell out of the nest. We named it Lopsy. After doing some research we felt there was a chance that it might survive, but we weren't sure that it would ever be able to fly. A hurt bird doesn't stand much of a chance of survival and could fall easy pray  to cats, other animals. Was it fair to allow it to live if it meant keeping it in a cage its whole life? It was a hard decision, but we decided to give it a go.  We started off by dripping drops of water into its mouth. It was very thirsty and drank quite a bit. Next we fed it with bread soaked in water. Our household routine  soon revolved around Lopsy who needed to be fed about every three hours during the day. Fortunately we live on campus and my husband could come home during his breaks to feed our new baby. Soon Lopsy was growing nicely. The bigger it got, the more vocal  it became. There was no doubt as to who was ruling the house.  We remained concerned because its leg did not heal, and its wing seemed quite useless. I took it outside for exercise every day. I also hoped it would get used to the sights and sounds of nature. In the beginning all it was interested in was staying as close to me as possible. Anyway, it got stronger and started running on the grass, and one day Lopsy found a fence it liked. It got to the point where I would leave it outside under its fence for about two hours at a time while I kept an eye on developments from our kitchen window. Soon Lopsy figured out how to get from one branch to another.[:   ] It also got to the point where it could flutter down from my hand to the ground, and I let it do this over and over again to exercise its wings. Then came the day that it actually flew into the fence. We were overjoyed when this happened. Finally it got to the point where I left it outside in its fence all day and night, but I would still go outside to feed it. Lopsy remained vocal and would jumped over for its food as soon as I came into view. I left some bread on the wall next to its fence, but it would have none of it. The little fellow was totally spoilt and wanted to be spoon fed, but I saw him eating quite happily as soon as I left his line of vision. Some of the bigger species of birds were a bit aggressive towards Lopsy, and I continued to keep a close eye on it. Not long after this we saw Lopsy flying without a problem. It still jumped to the side, but that didn't seem to stop it in any way. Other birds seemed quite curious about Lopsy. At first it chased them away if they came too close to its fence, but Lopsy soon seemed to realize that they were of its own kind and it stopped doing so. Then, one day, our fellow left the nest. We never saw it again, but I know Little Lopsy is now leading a happy life. This experience has taught me much. The author placed the box holding the bird outside the front door so that   _  .",her parents could take care of the bird for her,the bird could get some food outside by itself,the bird's parents could find it and bring it food,the bird could recover faster from its sickness,C
967,"Long ago, there was a queen who lived in a palace. She felt bored and said to her advisor( ), ""AIl the things around me are too boring. I need a different kind of beauty. Let everyone know that I will hold a competition for the most beautiful thing in the world. And the prize will be this crown  ."" Several days later, lots of people came to the competition and showed their things. The queen was not satisfied with what she saw. The advisor suggested, ""What you are looking for cannot be brought to you. You must look for it by yourself. What about a journey?"" The queen was interested in the idea, so she started immediately. As she was on top of the hill near her palace, she looked down and suddenly something cried in her heart. ""Why have I never found my palace so beautiful?"" The queen spent one year travelling.

970,"This might not sound so extraordinary, but I didn't just read a book in print, on an e-reader or even on a mobile phone. Instead, I read a book on dozens of devices . I was not trying to set a Guinness world record. I wanted to answer a question I often hear: which e-reader or tablet is the best for reading books? So I set out to try them all, reading a chapter on each: the Amazon Kindle, the first and second generation Apple iPads and mobile phones. To be fair, I also read a chapter in that old-fashioned form -- an old print paperback. The book I chose was The Alienist. For the first chapter, I turned to an Amazon Kindle. Shopping on Amazon for the Kindle is simple; you go to Amazon's Web site and buy the book, which is then sent to any devices with Kindle software installed . Reading on the Amazon Kindle is a joy in many aspects. The Kindle is light.Its six-inch screen is the perfect size for reading, and reading on its black and white E Ink display doesn't harm your eyes. Battery life is outstanding; on average you charge the device only once a month. My only complaint with the Kindle design is the placement of the keyboard at the bottom of the device. Amazon's CEO has noted during past product announcements that the keyboard is there to help people take notes or search. But to me,it seems like a waste of space. Despite the small screen on a mobile phone, I find reading on one to be simple and satisfactory. All of the mobile phones on which I read chapters felt somewhat similar; although screen brightness and the size of the phone's screen did vary. If I had wanted to, I could have bought my book through dozens of e-book apps   in the Apple App Store. Most are free and offer access to thousands of free e-books or paid versions. But the big downside for many is that you can read them only on Apple devices. Both iPads 1&2 offer an immersive reading experience. I found myself jumping back and forth between my book and the Web, looking up old facts and pictures of New York City. I also found myself being sucked into the wormhole of the Internet and a few games of Angry Birds rather than reading my book. For the last chapters of the book, I read the paperback, which is still my favourite choice. Since we are comparing devices so I guess I need to choose one. In the end it might come down to Kindle. But if money is tight, go for print. My used paperback cost only$4 from Amazon. A possible customer would not buy iPads 1 & 2 for reading because   _  .",most e-book apps must be downloaded first,only paid-version e-books can be read on it,much information is lost at times when reading,attention is easily taken away when reading on it,D
971,"If you know something is bad for you, why can't you just stop? About 70% of smokers say they would like to stop. Drug and alcohol abusers   struggle to give up the bad habits that hurt their bodies and destroy families and friendships. And many of us have unhealthy weight that we could lose if only we would eat right and exercise more. So why don't we do it? Some scientists have been searching for answers. They've studied what happens in our brains as habits form. They've found answers to why bad habits, once formed, are so difficult to kick. And they're developing ways to help us make the changes we'd like to make. Habits are a normal part of life, and are often helpful. "" We wake up every morning, shower, comb our hair or brush our teeth without being aware of it,"" Volkow says. We can drive along familiar routes without really thinking about the directions. ""When behaviors become automatic , it gives us an advantage, because the brain does not have to perform the action on purpose."" Volkow says. This frees up our brains to focus on different things. One way to kick bad habits is to focus on your unhealthy habits. Then try your best to stop them. For example, habits can be linked in our minds to certain places and activities. You could develop a plan, say, to avoid walking down the hall where there's a candy machine. Try to avoid going places where you've usually smoked. Stay away from friends and situations linked to problem drinking or drug use. Another helpful way is to replace unhealthy habits with new, healthy ones. ""It doesn't work for everyone,"" Volkow says.

975,"Relationships in general have gone downhill because of two factors:technology and our demanding drive for excitement. Body language, especially eye contact, is very important to a relationship. With one glance we can tell the mood of a close friend, if they are happy or sad. Thus, visual contact has a major impact on the amount of understanding we have with another person and the amount of connection that can be achieved. However, when the telephone, email and message come into play, all of that human interaction is lost. We have increasingly less human contact and start lacking social skills because of a lack of communication. Technology greatly influences our standpoint on how fast we think everything needs to be done. If you put a dollar in the soda machine, you expect the bottle to move forward and fall down to the bottom. You can' t count how many times you' ve  _ the machine if it went too slow for your expectations. You wanted instant results, immediate fulfillment. Another shot against healthy relationships is everyone ' s demanding need for excitement. Society in general has increased its expectations for excitement. Little kids spending time playing outside together now replace that with hours of playing video games alone at home.

977,"SHANGHAI, June 7(AP)--A 16-year-old girl's suicide after she was barred from a key exam draw attention to increasing worries over academic pressures, as millions of Chinese students began annual college entrance tests on Wednesday.  The three-day exam, viewed as important to future career and financial success, has a record 9.5 million high school students across prefix = st1 /Chinacompeting for just 2.6 million university places. For kids and parents alike, it's a difficulty that experts say causes extreme emotional distress. ""Pressure from study and exams is a top reason for psychological problems among Chinese youth,"" said Jin Wuguan, director of the Youth Psychological Counseling Center at Shanghai'sRuijinHospital.  In China's increasingly success oriented, pressure-cooker cities, academic stress is seen as a rising cause of youth suicides and even murders of parents by children who are driven crazy by intolerable pressure to perform.  According to her family and newspaper accounts, 16-year-old Wu Wenwen drowned herself after she was stopped at the exam room door because her hair wasn't tied back as her school required. Returning in tied hair, she was then told the end-of-term exam had already started and she was too late to take it. In tears, Wu called her mother, and then disappeared. Her body was found the same night in a nearby lake.  China doesn't keep comprehensive statistics on student suicides, but Jin said health care professionals see the problem worsening, even among elementary students. Most Chinese schools still lack advisers and teachers receive little training in spotting symptoms of emotional distress, Jin said. Parents are little help, often piling on pressure while ignoring their children's emotional development, he said. ""It's a basic unwillingness or inability to recognize and deal with with emotional problems,"" Jin said.  Wang Yufeng, of Peking University's Institute of Mental, estimates the rate of emotional disorders such as depression among Chinese students under age 17 at up to 32 percent , a total of 30 million students.  Others say that figure may be as high as 50 percent. A survey last year by the government's China Youth and ChildrenResearchCentershowed 57.6 percent of students felt highly distressed by academic pressures. We can learn from the passage that   _  .",the problem of student suicides is getting worse according to a research on the accurate statistics,teachers have enough ability to sense the emotional distress of students,parents place neither pressure nor care on their children,both teachers and parents should learn more to deal with the problem of student suicides.,D

In some ways,the relaxed attitude was shocking,says Melville.But it was a sign of how students' understanding of their role has changed. ""They have a more independent view of the university,and they feel free to comment,""said Melville. A committee,led by Melville,was set up earlier this year to explore the change in students' attitudes towards teachers.  ""This is something being driven by young people,""said Melville. ""They live surrounded by different kinds of electronic resources.They use social networking tools and things like Wikipedia.The first group of these students is now at university."" Students don't regard teaching staff in the same way as previous students did. ""Because Web2.0,  Google,Wikipedia are all about being able to change things yourself,students expect to be able to do this as well,""said Melville. There have been other changes in the student--teacher relationship.If students choose to study through a social networking group,they are in control.They don't always make staff welcome,and they are free to decide which staff members they allow in. ""Almost everybody who gets into using these kinds of technologies,it appears,becomes much shallower in their research,""said Melville.

980,"Hanukkah Hanukkah   is a Jewish festival. It is celebrated on the 25th day of the Jewish month of Kislev  , which is usually sometime in December. It is often called the festival of lights. The festival celebrates the time, over 2,000 years ago, when the Jewish people fought against an emperor who would not let them follow their own traditions and religion. When the Jewish people won back their temple in Jerusalem, they found there was only enough holy oil to keep the sacred light burning for one day. However, to their surprise, this small amount of oil kept the light burning for eight days and nights, until the people had time to make more oil. At the center of the Hanukkah celebrations is a candlestick (called a Menorah) that holds nine candles. On the first night of Hanukkah the first candle is lit, and each day this candle is used to light another candle, until on the eighth day, the last day, all the candles are lit. During Hanukkah, people go to the synagogue   to pray and to remember the miracle   of the holy oil. Hanukkah is a time for family and friends to come together.

They took 160 caffeine-free people and showed them pictures of everyday objects. These people were asked if the objects could be found inside the house, or outdoors.Then some of the subjects were given a caffeine pill.The others were given a placebo--a pill containing nothing. 24 hours later,the subjects were shown the exact same images from the day before.They were also shown images with slight differences,and some completely new images. Both groups correctly identified the exact same and completely new pictures.But those who took the caffeine pill were better at spottingthe pictures that were slightly different. Professor Yassa says their answers helped to show the effects of caffeine on memory. And  we find that if they are on caffeine they are much more likely to make the right decision.""

982,"Have you ever noticed the colour of the water in a river or stream after a heavy rainfall? What do you think caused this change in colour? It is soil that has been washed into the river from the riverbank or from the nearby fields. Components of Soil Soil is made up of a number of layers, each having its own distinctive colour and texture. The upper layer is known as the litter. It acts like a blanket,limiting temperature changes and reducing water loss. The topsoil layer is made up of small particles of rock mixed with rotten plant and animal matter called humus  , which is black and gives the topsoil its dark colour. This layer is usually rich in nutrients, oxygen, and water. Below the topsoil is the subsoil, a layer that contains more stones mixed with only small amounts of organic matter. This layer is lighter in colour because of the lack of humus. Beneath the soil lies a layer of bedrock. Soil forms from the bottom up. Over time bedrock is attacked by rain, wind, frost, and snow. It is gradually broken down into smaller particles in a process called weathering. Plants begin to grow,and rotten materials enrich the topsoil. Most of the soil in Eastern Canada ,for example ,was formed from weathered rock that was exposed when the ice disappeared 12,000 years ago. Water Beneath the Soil Surface water collects and flows above the ground in lakes ,ponds, and rivers. Once in the soil or rock, it is called groundwater. Gravity pulls groundwater through the soil in a process called percolation . Eventually the water reaches a layer called the water table. Under this is bedrock through which water cannot percolate. As water percolates downward, it _ organic matter and minerals from the soil and carries them to deeper layers.This causes a serious problem because plants require these nutrients for growth. Soil pH Soil can be acidic, neutral, or basic. The pH of the soil is determined by the nature of the rock from which it was formed,and by the nature of the plants that grow and rot in it. The acidity of rain and snow can lower the pH of the groundwater that enters the soil. By burning fossil fuels such as coal ,oil and gasoline,humans have been contributing to higher levels of acidity in many soils. When fossil fuels are burned,gases are released into the air and then fall back to earth as acid rain. Acid soil increases the problem of carrying nutrients to lower soil levels. As nutrients are removed,soil is less fertile. Plants grow more slowly in acidic soil,and also become easily attacked by diseases. The layer of soil that provides necessary nutrients for plant growth is called  _  .",litter,subsoil,humus,topsoil,D

I've been there, and so have many other people all over the world. Shyness is like a snake that crawls  into our mouths and stops us speaking. But we shouldn't let it stay there. I am 29 years old. Even today, that snake still sometimes visits me. But when I was in high school, I was so shy that I wouldn't talk to anyone except my parents and best friends. If a stranger asked me the way to a local shop, it was as if I'd forgotten how to talk. One summer, I got a job in a restaurant and that helped a lot. It meant I had to talk to customers. I had to tell them how much their meal cost. I had to ask them if they wanted to drink Coke or Sprite. I had to tell the people in the kitchen if someone wanted pickle on their sandwich. This job taught me how to speak with people. You may not be old enough to find a part-time job. But you can look for other chances to speak with people. You can offer to help an old woman carry her heavy bag. Or you can go to get a newspaper for your family. If you do these things for a while, the ""shyness"" snake will soon begin to leave you alone. It'll look for another mouth to crawl into.

989,"When Nick Pasqua hits his bedroom after school, he's tired. The 14-year-old high school freshman from New Rochele, New York, plays computer video games online for a couple of hours, pausing only to instant-message his friends, check his blog or download a new song to his IPOD. When his cell phone vibrates , he scans the text message and fires back a reply. ""We're leagues behind,"" sighs Nick's mom, Kimberly Pasqua, 45. And many parents like her are feeling increasingly out of step with their children. The technology gap between parents and kids is widening, says Amenda Lenhart, senior research specialist for Internet & American Life Project, a research group that explores the impact of the Internet on children and families. In a series of reports released last year, researchers found that 87 percent of the prefix = st1 /United States' kids aged 12 to 17 use the Internet, compared to only 66 percent of adults. Half of those teens go online daily. Eighty-one percent play games online and 75 percent use instant-messaging. Nearly half(45 percent) have a cell phone. One out of five has a blog. Why are children increasing past their parents? Because today's kids learn to use computers by playing and think technology is fun, says Lenhart. But adults generally view computers as mere tools for work , not toys. Despite this difference, most parents realize that computers, cell phones and the like are fixtures  in their children's lives. With that acceptance comes worry about what makes appropriate usage and more important, what's safe. Experts say the best way to keep up is to learn the technology for yourself. Visit blogs. Send some instant and text messages. Download music. ""This stuff may never be as necessary to your life as it is to your kids,"" says Susannah Stern, assistant professor in the Communications Department at UniversityofSan Diego, ""but you won't get their respect about online issues if you don't know what they're talking about."" Children can be great teachers, so let them show you the ropes. ""It's empowering for them to share their knowledge,"" says Stern.

990,"In the English language, there are many expressions using the word ""mouth"". For example, if you say bad things about a person, the person might protest  and say ""Do not bad mouth me.""     Sometimes, people say something to a friend or family member that they later regret because it hurts that person's feelings. Or they tell the person something they were not supposed to tell. The speaker might say :""I really put my foot in my mouth this time."" If this should happen, the speaker might feel down in the mouth.   In other words, he might feel sad for saying the wrong thing.     Information is often spread through word of mouth. This is general communication between people, like friends talking to each other. ""How did you hear about that new movie?"" someone might ask. ""Oh, by word of mouth.""     Sometimes when one person is speaking ,he says the same thing that his friend was going to say . When this happens, the friend might say ""You took the words right out of my mouth."" Sometimes a person has a bad or unpleasant experience with another person ,he might say ""I had my heart in my mouth.""     Some people have lots of money because they were born into a very rich family. You might say such a person ""was born with a silver spoon in his mouth ."" This rich person is the opposite of a person who lives from hand to mouth. This person is very poor and only has enough money for the most important things in life.    Parents might sometimes keep sweet food from a child ad punishment for saying bad things,  For example , if a child says things she should not say to her parents , she might be described as a mouthy child. The parents might even tell the child to stop mouthing off.

992,"Would you completely trust your friends if you couldn't see anything? If you are falling, do you believe they will catch you and help you stand up? Our teacher helped us to find the answer. Our teacher is named Morrie. One day, he said that he had a game for us to try. He divided us into two groups. One of the students from the first group, stands in front of us with his eyes closed, and then falls backwards . The second group stand behind him. Before he falls on the floor, they should catch him and not let him get hurt. Most of us were uncomfortable with this. We were afraid that they wouldn't catch us and we would hit the floor. So we didn't move. We just stood there and laughed in embarrassment . Finally, one student, thin, quiet, dark-haired girl called Sarah, decided to move. She crossed her arms in front of her body, closed her eyes, and slowly fell backwards. She looked quiet but brave. For a moment, I was sure she was going to fall on the floor. But before she hit the floor, the other students caught her, held her and finally helped her stand up. ""Whoa!!"" we were all surprised, and also encouraged. The girl was happy, too. Seeing this, Morrie smiled and said to the girl, ""When you close your eyes, you can't see anything. You won't feel safe. When you are falling, the feeling gets stronger.

He walks painfully, yet majestically, until he reaches his chair.Then he sits down,slowly, puts his crutches on the floor, undoes the clasps on his legs,tucks one foot back and extends the other foot forward.Then he bends down and picks up the violin, puts it under his chin,nods to the conductor and proceeds to play.

We figured that he would have to get up,put on the clasps again,pick up the crutches and limp his way off stage-to either find another violin or else find another string for this one.But he didn't.Instead.he waited a moment,closed his eyes and then signaled the conductor to begin again. The orchestra began,and he played from where he had left off.And he played with such passion and such power and such purity as they had never heard before.

997,"People have strange ideas about food. For example, tomato is a kind of very delicious vegetable. It is one of useful plants that can be prepared in many ways. It has rich nutrition  and vitamin in it. But in the 18th century, Americans never ate tomatoes. They grew them in their gardens because tomato plants are so pretty. But they thought the vegetable was poisonous . They called tomatoes ""poison apples"". President Thomas Jefferson, however, knew that tomatoes were good to eat. He was a learned man. He had been to Paris, where he learned to love the taste of tomatoes. He grew many kinds of tomatoes in his garden. The President taught his cook a way for a cream of tomato soup. This beautiful pink soup was served at the President party. The guests thought the soup tasted really good. They never thought their president would serve his honored guests poison apples. Jefferson never spoke to his honored guests about the fact. According to the passage, which of the following is NOT TRUE?",None of the guests knew the soup that was served at the President's party was made of tomatoes.,All of the guests thought the soup which was prepared by the President's cook was nice.,President Thomas Jefferson knew that tomatoes were good to eat and not poisonous at all.,All of the guests didn't know that their president would serve his honored guests poison apples.,A

999,"Farming is moving indoors, where the sun never shines, where rainfall is irrelevant   and where the climate is always right. The perfect crop field could be inside a windowless building with controlled light, temperature,humidity,air quality and nutrition. It could be in a New York high- rise or a complex   in the Saudi desert. It may be an answer to the world's food problems. The world already is having trouble feeding itself. Half the people on Earth live in cities, and nearly half of those - about 3 billion - are hungry or ill-fed. Food prices, currently increasing, are badly affected by dryness, floods and the cost of energy required to plant, harvest and transport it. And prices will only get more unstable. Climate change makes long-term crop planning uncertain. Farmers in many parts of the world already are using water available to the last drop. And the world is getting more crowded: by mid-century, the global population will grow from 6.8 billion to 9 billion. To feed so many people may require expanding farmland at the expense of forests and wilderness, or finding ways to greatly increase crop output. Gertjan Meeuws and three other Dutch bioengineers grow vegetables and house plants in closed and regulated environments. In their research station, water flows into the pans when needed, and the temperature is kept constant. Lights go on and off, creating ""day"" and ""night"", but according to the rhythm of the plant. Meeuws says a building of 100 square meters and layers of plants could provide a daily diet of 200 grams of fresh fruit and vegetables for the entire population of Ken Bosch, about 140,000 people. Their idea isn't to grow foods that require much space, like corn or potatoes. Sunlight is not only unnecessary but can be harmful. Plants need only specific wavelengths of light to grow. Their growth rate is three times faster than under greenhouse conditions. They use about 90 percent less water than outdoor agriculture. And city farming means producing food near the consumer, so there's on need to transport it long distances. What is the purpose of the text ?",To compare traditional and indoor farming.,To discuss the influence of climate change.,To explain the world's food problem.,To introduce a new model of farming.,D
